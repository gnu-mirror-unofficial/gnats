	 <H2>Handling MIME e-mail messages in GNATS</H2> 
	 <P>A well-known problem for many users of GNATS is that MIME-ified mail
		messages are handled badly by GNATS. MIME is a standard way for "rich" content
		to be transferred by e-mail . This content might consist of arbitrary
		attachments with content such as images, sounds, executable files or plain
		text. A typical MIME e-mail message contains a plaintext part first, and then
		one or more parts containing attachments.</P> 
	 <P>Currently, GNATS makes no attempt to decode these messages. This is
		especially noticeable when letters such &aelig;, &ouml;, &szlig;, &aring; etc.
		are used in the subject field of PRs submitted by e-mail. Such messages get a
		synopsis containing the rather ugly looking string "=?iso-8859-1?Q?",
		underscores instead of spaces and the special letters themselves replaced by
		strings such as =F8, =E8 etc. In the message body, all special characters are
		replaced by =XX strings. These strings are commonly referred to as <I>quoted
		printables</I>. Thus, quoted printables will also be present in the Description
		field of the PR if the message body contained international characters.</P> 
	 <P>Most modern e-mail clients decode MIME e-mail messages properly,
		removing the iso string, translating underscores back to spaces and quoted
		printables to their special letter counterparts. However, GNATS does not
		contain functionality for this, so e-mail messages are filed directly into the
		database without any translation.</P> 
	 <P>Another big problem arises when users submit PRs by e-mail, containing
		attachments. Those parts of the message that contain binary data is simply
		dumped as long encoded blocks of data into the PR description, together with
		whatever plaintext the message might contain.</P> 
	 <P>The easiest way to solve this is by placing a parser script at the
		beginning of the line in the GNATS mail alias that pipes messages into
		queue-pr. The following Perl script uses Perl MIME modules to decode the
		message. It fully decodes headers and bodies of messages, stripping out parts
		of a message that are not plain text, decoding those parts and saving them to
		an archive directory. Separate directories are made to hold the contents of
		each message. A reference is then inserted into the original message, stating
		the location of the saved file. The parts of the message that were originally
		in plaintext get their quoted printables translated and are otherwise left
		alone.</P> 
	 <P>In order to use the script below, you need to download and install the
		following Perl modules on your system. Get the latest versions listed on the
		following pages:</P>
