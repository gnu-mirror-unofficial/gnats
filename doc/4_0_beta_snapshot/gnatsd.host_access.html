<h3>Overall access levels per host</h3>

<p>The host access file (by default
<code>/usr/local/etc/gnats/gnatsd.host_access</code>) controls overall
access levels on a per-host basis, meaning that settings in this file
apply across all databases on the server.  Entries in this file are in
the following format:

<p><var>host:access-level:whatever</var>

<p><var>host</var> is the hostname or IP address of the host contacting
gnatsd.  Wildcard characters are supported: <code>*</code> matches anything;
<code>?</code> matches any single character.  By using wildcards, you can
specify access levels for entire network subnets and domains.

<p>The second field is the access level of <var>host</var>.  The default is
<code>deny</code>.  If the user's hostname isn't in the file or its access
level is set to <code>deny</code>, the connection is closed immediately.

<p><small>GNATS</small> currently doesn't make use of the third field. Remember to
still include the second <code>:</code> on the line if you choose to leave the third
field empty.

<p>Whenever a <code>CHDB</code> command is processed (or defaulted), the user's
access level is set to the level for their host, as determined by the
values in the <code>gnatsd.host_access</code> file.  However, even if a host
is given the <code>none</code> access level, an individual can still give the
<code>USER</code> command to possibly gain a higher (but never lower) access
than is set for their host.  The gnatsd <code>USER</code> command takes two
arguments: <code>USER &lt;userid&gt; &lt;passwd&gt;</code>.
