<h4>The <code>submitters</code> file</h4>

<p>This is a database of sites which submit bugs to your support site.  It
contains six fields delineated by colons.  Lines beginning with <code>#</code>
will be ignored.

<p>Entries are of the format:

<br><pre><var>submitter-id</var>:<var>name</var>:<var>type</var>:<var>resp-time</var>:<var>contact</var>:<var>notify</var>
</pre>

<dl>
<dt><var>submitter-id</var>
<dd>A unique identifier for a specific site or other entity who submits
Problem Reports. The first <code>submitter-id</code> listed in the file will
be the default for PRs that arrive with invalid or empty submitter
fields.

<br><dt><var>name</var>
<dd>The full name or a description of this entity.

<br><dt><var>type</var>
<dd>Optional description for the type of relationship of this submitter to
your support site.  This could indicate a contract type, a level of
expertise, etc., or it can remain blank.

<br><dt><var>resp-time</var>
<dd>Optional quoted response time in <dfn>business hours</dfn>.  If the
database <code>dbconfig</code> file has the <code>notify-about-expired-prs</code>
entry set to <var>true</var> (see <a href="Overall-database-configuration.html#Overall%20database%20configuration">Overall database configuration</a>, <small>GNATS</small> will use
this field to schedule when it should notify the gnats-admin,
responsible person and submitter contact that the PR wasn't analyzed
within the agreed response time.  Business hours and business-week
days are set in the <code>dbconfig</code> file.  For information on
<code>at-pr</code>, the program which sends out this reminder, see
<a href="at-pr.html#at-pr">Timely Reminders</a>.

<br><dt><var>contact</var>
<dd>The name tag of the main <dfn>contact</dfn> at the Support Site for this
submitter.  This contact should be in the <code>responsible</code> file
(see <a href="responsible-file.html#responsible%20file">The <code>responsible</code> file</a>).  Incoming bugs
from <var>submitter</var> are sent to this contact.  Optionally, this field
can be left blank.

<br><dt><var>notify</var>
<dd>Any other parties who should receive copies of Problem Reports sent in
by <var>submitter</var>.  They need not be listed in the <code>responsible</code> file. 
</dl>

<p>A few example entries in the <code>submitters</code> file:

<br><pre>univ-hell:University of Hades:eternal:3:beelzebub:lucifer
tta:Telephones and Telegraphs of America:support:720:dave:
</pre>

<p>In this example, when a PR comes in from the University of Hades (who
has an eternal contract), it should have <code>univ-hell</code> in its
<code>Submitter-Id</code> field.  This Problem Report goes to <code>beelzebub</code>
(who should be in the <code>responsible</code> file), and if it is not
analyzed within three business hours a reminder message is sent. 
<code>lucifer</code> also receives a copy of the bug, and a copy of the
reminder message as well (if it is sent).  When Telephones and
Telegraphs of America utilizes their support contract and submits a bug,
a copy is sent only to <code>dave</code>, who has 720 business hours to return
an analysis before a reminder is sent.

<p>To disable the feature of <small>GNATS</small> which tracks the
<code>Submitter-Id</code>, simply alter the <code>submitters</code> file to only
contain one <var>submitter-id</var> value, and instruct your submitters to
ignore the field.
