<h4>The <code>categories</code> file</h4>

<p>The <code>categories</code> file contains a list of problem categories,
specific to the database, which <small>GNATS</small> tracks.  This file also
matches responsible people with these categories.  You must edit this
file initially, creating valid categories.  In most installations,
<small>GNATS</small> is configured to create directories on disk for valid
categories automatically as needed (see <a href="Overall-database-configuration.html#Overall%20database%20configuration">Overall database configuration</a>). If <small>GNATS</small> isn't set
up to do this, you need to run <code>mkcat</code> to create the corresponding
subdirectories of the database directory. For instructions on running
<code>mkcat</code>, see <a href="mkcat.html#mkcat">Adding a problem category</a>.

<p>To create a new category, log in as <small>GNATS</small>, add a line to this file,
and run <code>mkcat</code> if applicable.  Lines beginning with <code>#</code> are
ignored.

<p>A line in the <code>categories</code> file consists of four fields delimited
by colons, as follows:

<br><pre><var>category</var>:<var>description</var>:<var>responsible</var>:<var>notify</var>
</pre>

<dl>
<dt><var>category</var>
<dd>A unique category name, made up of text characters.  This name cannot
contain spaces or any of the following characters:

<br><pre>! $ &amp; * ( ) { } [ ] ` ' " ; : &lt; &gt; ~
</pre>

<p>Ideally, category names should not contain commas or begin with periods. 
Each line has a corresponding subdirectory in the database directory.

<br><dt><var>description</var>
<dd>A terse textual description of the category.

<br><dt><var>responsible</var>
<dd>The name tag of the party responsible for this category of problems, as
listed in the <code>responsible</code> file (see <a href="responsible-file.html#responsible%20file">The <code>responsible</code> file</a>).

<br><dt><var>notify</var>
<dd>One or more other parties which should be notified when a Problem Report
with this category arrives, such as a project manager, other members of
the same project, other interested parties, or even log files.  These
should be separated with commas. 
</dl>

<p>A good strategy for configuring this file is to have a different
category for each product your organization supports or wishes to track
information for.

<br><pre>rock:ROCK program:me:myboss,fred
stone:STONE utils:barney:fred
iron:IRON firewall:me:firewall-log
</pre>

<p>In the above example, the nametags <code>myboss</code>, <code>me</code>,
<code>fred</code>, and <code>barney</code> must be defined in the <code>responsible</code>
file (see <a href="responsible-file.html#responsible%20file">The <code>responsible</code> file</a>).

<p>Problem Reports with a category of <code>rock</code> are sent to the local
mail address (or alias) <code>me</code>, and also sent to the addresses
<code>myboss</code> and <code>fred</code>.  PRs with a category of <code>stone</code> are
sent to the local addresses <code>barney</code> and <code>fred</code> only, while
PRs with the category <code>iron</code> are sent only to <code>me</code>, and are
also filed in <code>firewall-log</code> (in this case, a mail alias should be set
up, see <a href="Aliases.html#Aliases">Setting up mail aliases</a>.

<p>If you want to separate PRs in each problem category into specific
subsets, say <em>documentation</em> and <em>software bugs</em>,
using the <code>classes</code> file is recommended.  See <a href="classes-file.html#classes%20file">The <code>classes</code> file</a>.

<p>Only one category <em>must</em> be present for <small>GNATS</small> to function:

<br><pre>pending:Non-categorized PRs:gnats-admin:
</pre>

<p>The <code>pending</code> directory is created automatically when you run
<code>mkdb</code> to initialize a new database.  (see <a href="Configure-and-make.html#Configure%20and%20make">Configuring and compiling the software</a>).
