<h2><code>dbconfig</code> recipes</h2>

<p>The <code>dbconfig</code> file (<a href="dbconfig-file.html#dbconfig%20file">The <code>dbconfig</code> file</a>) is the heart of any <small>GNATS</small> installation.  It contains some
very powerful machinery, something which this appendix tries to
illustrate.

<p>We provide a range of examples that are both intended to be useful in
their own right and to serve as starting points or building blocks for
your own modifications.

<h5>Provide Gnatsweb URL in initial response</h5>

<p>Sites that have Gnatsweb installed may wish to modify the response
e-mail which is sent to the submitter of a PR so that it includes a
URL where the status of the PR can be monitored.  In order to allow
this, you should first create an entry in <code>gnatsd.user_access</code>
which allows viewing of PRs in your database
(See <a href="gnatsd.user_access.html#gnatsd.user_access">The <code>gnatsd.user_access</code> file</a>.)

<p>Next, locate the entry <code>mail-format
"initial-response-to-submitter"</code> in the <code>dbconfig</code> file of your
database and add the following <em>before</em> the line reading "The
individual assigned..." in the <code>body</code> section:

<pre>
\nYou can follow the status of this report on\n\
http://hostname/cgi-bin/scriptname?\n\
cmd=view&database=dbname&user=username&\n\
password=passwd&pr=%s\n\n\
</pre>

<p>Substitute <code>hostname</code>, <code>cgi-bin</code> and <code>scriptname</code> as
appropriate for the setup of your web server.  The part before the
<code>?</code> would typically look something like
<code>http://www.example.com/cgi-bin/gnatsweb.pl</code>.  Substitute the
name of your database for <code>dbname</code>, and the username and password
of the user with <code>view</code> rights for <code>username</code> and
<code>passwd</code>.

<p>Next, add a <code>Number</code> to the <code>fields</code> list statement inside
the <code>body</code> so it reads as follows:

<pre>
fields { "Category" "Number" "Number" "Responsible"
         "Category" "Responsible" "Synopsis"
         "Arrival-Date" }
</pre>

<h5>State full name of responsible in initial response</h5>

<p>The initial e-mail response to the submitter of a PR identifies the
responsible person assigned to the PR as follows: "The individual
assigned to look at your report is: <var>GNATS username</var>".  Some
sites may wish to modify this so that the full name of the responsible
person is used instead of the <small>GNATS</small> user name.

<p>The full name is contained in the <code>fullname</code> subfield of the
user's entry in the <code>responsible</code> file and can be accessed as
<code>Responsible[fullname]</code> (see <a href="administrative-files.html#administrative%20files">Enumerated field administrative files</a>.)

<p>The change is achieved by editing the <code>dbconfig</code> item
<code>mail-format "initial-response-to-submitter"</code> and changing the
<code>fields</code> part of the <code>Body</code> from

<pre>
fields { "Category" "Number" "Responsible"
         "Category" "Responsible" "Synopsis"
         "Arrival-Date" }
</pre>

<p>to

<pre>
fields { "Category" "Number" "Responsible[fullname]"
         "Category" "Responsible" "Synopsis"
         "Arrival-Date" }
</pre>

<h5>Append-only Audit-Trail</h5>

<p>The Audit-Trail of a PR is by default editable.  For some
applications, one might want to make the Audit-Trail append-only, so
it provides a full and unchangeable case history.  Also by default,
only certain changes, such as change of state and change of
responsible gets recorded in the Audit-Trail.  In some cases, it might
also be convenient to have a way of inserting comments directly into
the Audit-Trail.

<p>The following procedure creates such an append-only Audit-Trail and
adds a PR field which makes it possible to register comments in the
Audit-Trail.

<p>First, add the keyword <code>read-only</code> to the Audit-Trail field
definition in <code>dbconfig</code>.

<p>Then, add the following field definition to <code>dbconfig</code>:

<pre>
field "Add-To-Audit-Trail" {
   description "Add a log entry to the Audit Trail"
   multitext { default "\n" }
   on-change  {
        add-audit-trail
        audit-trail-format {
        format "**** Comment added by %s on %s ****\n %s\n\n"
        fields { "$EditUserEmailAddr" "$CurrentDate" "$NewValue"
        }
        }
    }
    on-change {
        set-field "Add-To-Audit-Trail" { "\n" }
    }
}
</pre>

<h5>Supporting <small>GNATS</small> "release-based" fields</h5>

<p>When installing <small>GNATS</small> version 3.x, it was possible to choose
whether to enable three optional fields: <code>Quarter</code>, <code>Keywords</code>
and <code>Date-Required</code>.  Default installations had these fields
switched off, and installations which had them were called
"release-based".

<p>The default <code>dbconfig</code> shipped with <small>GNATS</small> version 4 or newer
does not have these fields, so if you are upgrading from an old
release-based system, you need to add the following field definitions to
your <code>dbconfig</code> file:

<pre>
field "Quarter" {
    description "What quarter does the PR fall into?"
    text
    query-default inexact-regexp
    textsearch
}

field "Keywords" {
    description "Keywords used to index this PR"
    text
    query-default inexact-regexp
    textsearch
}

field "Date-Required" {
    description "Date that the PR must be fixed by"
    date
}
</pre>

<p>A side note: Pre-release versions of <small>GNATS</small> 4 also had a field
named <code>Cases</code>.  For those who may need it, here is the field
definition of <code>Cases</code>:

<pre>
field "Cases" {
    text
    query-default inexact-regexp
    textsearch
}
</pre>
