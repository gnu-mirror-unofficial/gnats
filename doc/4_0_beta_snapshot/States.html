<h3>States of Problem Reports</h3>

<p>Each PR goes through a defined series of states between origination and
closure.  By default, the originator of a PR receives notification
automatically of any state changes.

<p>Unless your site has customized states (see <a href="../gnats/states-file.html#states%20file">states file</a>), <small>GNATS</small> uses these states:

<dl>
<dt><dfn>open</dfn>
<dd>The initial state of a Problem Report.  This means the PR has been filed
and the responsible person(s) notified.

<br><dt><dfn>analyzed</dfn>
<dd>The responsible person has analyzed the problem.  The analysis should
contain a preliminary evaluation of the problem and an estimate of the
amount of time and resources necessary to solve the problem.  It should
also suggest possible workarounds.

<br><dt><dfn>feedback</dfn>
<dd>The problem has been solved, and the originator has been given a patch
or other fix.  The PR remains in this state until the originator
acknowledges that the solution works.

<br><dt><dfn>closed</dfn>
<dd>A Problem Report is closed ("the bug stops here") only when any
changes have been integrated, documented, and tested, and the submitter
has confirmed the solution.

<br><dt><dfn>suspended</dfn>
<dd>Work on the problem has been postponed.  This happens if a timely
solution is not possible or is not cost-effective at the present time. 
The PR continues to exist, though a solution is not being actively
sought.  If the problem cannot be solved at all, it should be closed
rather than suspended.
