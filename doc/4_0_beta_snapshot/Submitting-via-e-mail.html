<h4>Submitting a Problem Report via direct e-mail</h4>

<p>In addition to using <code>send-pr</code>, there is another way to submit a
problem report.  You can simply send an e-mail message to the PR
submission e-mail address of the support site (This address should be
published by the support site.)

<p>When you send unformatted e-mail to this address, <small>GNATS</small> processes
the message as a new problem report, filling in as many fields from
defaults as it can:

<dl>
<dt><code>Synopsis</code>
<dd>The <code>Synopsis</code> field is filled in by the <code>Subject</code> header of
the e-mail message.

<br><dt><code>Submitter ID</code>
<dd><small>GNATS</small> will try to derive the <code>Submitter</code> field from the address
in the <code>From</code> header of the e-mail.

<br><dt><code>Description</code>
<dd>All of the text in the body of the e-mail message is put into the
<code>Description</code> field. 
</dl>

<p>Other fields, such as <code>Category</code>, <code>Version</code>, <code>Severity</code>,
etc. are set to default values as defined by the <small>GNATS</small> administrator.
