<h3>Description of <code>gnatsd</code></h3>

<p>The <code>gnatsd</code> network daemon is used to service remote <small>GNATS</small>
requests such as querying PRs, PR creation, deletion, and editing, and
miscellaneous database queries.  It uses a simple ASCII-based command
protocol (similar to SMTP or POP3) for communicating with remote
clients.

<p>It also provides a security model based either on IP-based
authentication (generally considered very weak) or username/passwords,
where passwords may be in cleartext, UNIX crypt or MD5 hash format. 
Access through <code>gnatsd</code> is granted according to certain predefined
<dfn>access levels</dfn>.  Access levels are further discussed in <a href="Access-Control.html#Access%20Control">Controlling access to databases</a>.  It should be emphasized that
security has not been a focus of development until now, but future
versions are expected to address this more thoroughly.

<p>All of the <small>GNATS</small> clients are capable of communicating via the <small>GNATS</small>
remote protocol to perform their functions.

<p><code>gnatsd</code> is usually started from the inetd facility and should run as
the <code>gnats</code> user (the actual username of this user is configurable
during installation, see <a href="Configure-and-make.html#Configure%20and%20make">Configuring and compiling the software</a> for details.)
