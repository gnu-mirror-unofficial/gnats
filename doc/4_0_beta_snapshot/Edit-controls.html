<h4>Edit controls</h4>

<p>The <code>on-change</code> subsection of a <code>fields</code> section specifies one
or more actions to be performed when the field value is edited by the
user.  It has the general form

<br><pre>on-change [ "query-expression" ] {
  [ add-audit-trail ]
  [ audit-trail-format {
    format "formatstring"
    [ fields { "fieldname" ... } ]
  } ]
  [ require-change-reason ]
  [ set-field | append-to-field "fieldname" {
    "format-string" [ fieldlist ]
  } ]
  [ require { "fieldname" ... } ]
}
</pre>

<p>The optional <code>query-expression</code> controls whether or not the actions
in the <code>on-change</code> section are taken.  If the expression fails to
match, the actions are skipped.

<p>The <code>add-audit-trail</code> option indicates that an entry should be
appended to the PR's audit-trail when this field is changed.  The format
of the entry is controlled by the optional <code>audit-trail-format</code>
section within the field, or by the global <code>audit-trail-format</code>
section. See <a href="Audit-trail-formats.html#Audit-trail%20formats">Audit-trail formats</a> and <a href="Outgoing-email-formats.html#Outgoing%20email%20formats">Outgoing email formats</a>.

<p>The <code>require-change-reason</code> option specifies that a change reason
must be present in the PR when this field is edited.  This option only
makes sense if an audit-trail entry is required, as the change reason is
otherwise unused.

<p>The <code>set-field</code> and <code>append-to-field</code> options are used to
change the value of the field <code>fieldname</code> in the PR.  The supplied
format is used to format the value that will be placed in the field.

<p><code>append-to-field</code> appends the resulting formatted string to the
existing, while <code>set-field</code> completely replaces the contents.

<p>Any field may be edited by the <code>set-field</code> or
<code>append-to-field</code> option (the <code>read-only</code> option on a field is
ignored).  However, the changes are subject to the usual field content
checks.

<p>The <code>require</code> option specifies that one or more fields must have
a (non-blank) value when this field is changed.

<p>A field may be enforced to have a (non-blank) value at all times by
including it in the set of fields required for the initial PR, see
<a href="Initial-PR-input-fields.html#Initial%20PR%20input%20fields">Initial PR input fields</a>, as well as in the set of fields
required on change of the field itself.

<p>There is also a global <code>on-change</code> section that is executed once
for each PR edit.  A typical use for such a section is to set the
last-modified date of the PR.
