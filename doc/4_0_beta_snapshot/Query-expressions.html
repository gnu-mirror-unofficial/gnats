<h4>Query expressions</h4>

<p>Query expressions are used to select specific PRs based on their field
contents.  The general form is

<br><pre>fieldname|"value" operator fieldname|"value" [booleanop ...]
</pre>

<p><var>value</var> is a literal string or regular expression; it must be
surrounded by double quotes, otherwise it is interpreted as a fieldname.

<p><var>fieldname</var> is the name of a field in the PR.

<p><var>operator</var> is one of:

<dl>
<dt><code>=</code>
<dd>The value of the left-hand side of the expression must exactly match the
regular expression on the right-hand side of the expression. 
See <a href="Regexps.html#Regexps">Querying using regular expressions</a>.

<br><dt><code>~</code>
<dd>Some portion of the left-hand side of the expression must match the
regular expression on the right-hand side.

<br><dt><code>==</code>
<dd>The value of the left-hand side must be equal to the value on the
right-hand side of the expression.

<p>The equality of two values depends on what type of data is stored in the
field(s) being queried.  For example, when querying a field containing
integer values, literal strings are interpreted as integers.  The query
expression

<br><pre>Number == "0123"
</pre>

<p>is identical to

<br><pre>Number == "123"
</pre>

<p>as the leading zero is ignored.  If the values were treated as strings
instead of integers, then the two comparisons would return different
results.

<br><dt><code>!=</code>
<dd>The not-equal operator. Produces the opposite result of the == operator.

<br><dt><code>&lt;,&gt;</code>
<dd>The left-hand side must have a value less than or greater than the
right-hand side.  Comparisons are done depending on the type of data
being queried; in particular, integer fields and dates use a numeric
comparison, and enumerated fields are ordered depending on the numeric
equivalent of their enumerated values. 
</dl>

<p><var>booleanop</var> is either <code>|</code> (logical or), or <code>&amp;</code> (logical
and).  The query expression

<br><pre>Category="baz" | Responsible="blee"
</pre>

<p>selects all PRs with a Category field of <code>baz</code> or a Responsible
field of <code>blee</code>.

<p>The not operator <code>!</code> may be used to negate a test:

<br><pre>! Category="foo"
</pre>

<p>searches for PRs where the category is not equal to the regular
expression foo.

<p>Parentheses may be used to force a particular interpretation of the
expression:

<br><pre>!(Category="foo" &amp; Submitter-Id="blaz")
</pre>

<p>skips PRs where the Category field is equal to <code>foo</code> and the
Submitter-Id field is equal to <code>blaz</code>.  Parentheses may be nested
to any arbitrary depth.

<p>Fieldnames can be specified in several ways.  The simplest and most
obvious is just a name:

<br><pre>Category="foo"
</pre>

<p>which checks the value of the category field for the value <var>foo</var>.

<p>A fieldname qualifier may be prepended to the name of the field; a colon
is used to separate the qualifier from the name.  To refer directly to a
builtin field name:

<br><pre>builtin:Number="123"
</pre>

<p>In this case, <code>Number</code> is interpreted as the builtin name of the
field to
check.  (This is useful if the fields have been renamed.  For further
discussion of builtin field names, see <a href="dbconfig-file.html#dbconfig%20file">The <code>dbconfig</code> file</a>.

<p>To scan all fields of a particular type, the <var>fieldtype</var> qualifier
may be
used:

<br><pre>fieldtype:Text="bar"
</pre>

<p>This searches all text fields for the regular expression <code>bar</code>.

<p>Note that it is not required that the right-hand side of the expression
be a literal string.  To query all PRs where the PR has been modified
since it was closed, the expression

<br><pre>Last-Modified != Closed-Date
</pre>

<p>will work; for each PR, it compares the value of its Last-Modified field
against its Closed-Date field, and returns those PRs where the values
differ.  However, this query will also return all PRs with empty
Last-Modified or Closed-Date fields.  To further narrow the search:

<br><pre>Last-Modified != Closed-Date &amp; Last-Modified != "" &amp; Closed-Date != ""
</pre>

<p>In general, comparing fields of two different types (an integer field
against a date field, for example) will probably not do what you want.

<p>Also, a field specifier may be followed by the name of a subfield in
braces:

<br><pre>State[type] != "closed"
</pre>

<p>or even

<br><pre>builtin:State[type] != "closed"
</pre>

<p>Subfields are further discussed in <a href="dbconfig-file.html#dbconfig%20file">The <code>dbconfig</code> file</a>.
