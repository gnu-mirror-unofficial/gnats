<h4>Problem Report fields</h4>

<h4>Field descriptions</h4>

<p>In a standard <small>GNATS</small> installation, certain fields will always be
present in a Problem Report.  If a PR arrives without one or more of
these fields, <small>GNATS</small> will add them, and if they have default
values set by the configuration at the Support Site, they will be
filled in with these values.  Certain tools such as <code>send-pr</code> are
set up to provide sensible defaults for most fields
(see <a href="send-pr.conf-file.html#send-pr.conf%20file">The send-pr.conf configuration file</a>.)

<p>In the list below, the field type (<code>text</code>, <code>multitext</code>,
<code>enumerated</code>, etc.) is supplied in parantheses.  The different
field types are explained briefly in <a href="Field-datatypes-reference.html#Field%20datatypes%20reference">Field datatypes reference</a>.

<dl>
<dt><code>Submitter-Id</code>
<dd>(<code>enumerated-in-file</code>) A unique identification code assigned by the
Support Site.  It is used to identify all Problem Reports coming from a
particular site.  Submitters without a value for this field can invoke
<code>send-pr</code> with the <code>--request-id</code> option to apply for one from
the support organization.  Problem Reports from those not affiliated
with the support organization should use the default value of <code>net</code>
for this field.

<p>See <a href="submitters-file.html#submitters%20file">The <code>submitters</code> file</a>, for details.

<br><dt><code>Notify-List</code>
<dd>(<code>text</code>) Comma-separated list of e-mail-addresses of people to
notify when the PR changes significantly, i.e. when the Audit-Trail
changes.  This list is independent from the Notify subfield of entries
in the <code>categories</code> file of the <small>GNATS</small> database.

<br><dt><code>Originator</code>
<dd>(<code>text</code>) Originator's real name.  Note that the Submitter and
Originator might not be the same person/entity in all cases.

<br><dt><code>Organization</code>
<dd>(<code>multitext</code>) The originator's organization.

<br><dt><code>Confidential</code>
<dd>(<code>enum</code>) Use of this field depends on the originator's relationship
with the support organization; contractual agreements often have
provisions for preserving confidentiality.  Conversely, a lack of a
contract often means that any data provided will not be considered
confidential.  Submitters should be advised to contact the support
organization directly if this is an issue.

<p>If the originator's relationship to the support organization provides
for confidentiality, then if the value of this field is <code>yes</code> the
support organization treats the PR as confidential; any code samples
provided are not made publicly available.

<br><dt><code>Synopsis</code>
<dd>(<code>text</code>) One-line summary of the problem.  <code>send-pr</code> copies
this information to the <code>Subject</code> line when you submit a Problem
Report.

<br><dt><code>Severity</code>
<dd>(<code>enum</code>) The severity of the problem.  By default, accepted
values include:

<dl>
<dt><code>critical</code>
<dd>The product, component or concept is completely non-operational or some
essential functionality is missing.  No workaround is known.

<br><dt><code>serious</code>
<dd>The product, component or concept is not working properly or significant
functionality is missing.  Problems that would otherwise be considered
<code>critical</code> are usually rated <code>serious</code> when a workaround is
known.

<br><dt><code>non-critical</code>
<dd>The product, component or concept is working in general, but lacks
features, has irritating behavior, does something wrong, or doesn't
match its documentation. 
</dl>

<br><dt><code>Priority</code>
<dd>(<code>enumerated</code>) How soon the originator requires a solution. 
Accepted values include:

<dl>
<dt><code>high</code>
<dd>A solution is needed as soon as possible.

<br><dt><code>medium</code>
<dd>The problem should be solved in the next release.

<br><dt><code>low</code>
<dd>The problem should be solved in a future release. 
</dl>

<br><dt><code>Category</code>
<dd>(<code>enumerated-in-file</code>) The name of the product, component or
concept where the problem lies.  The values for this field are defined
by the Support Site. 
See <a href="categories-file.html#categories%20file">The <code>categories</code> file</a>, for details.

<br><dt><code>Class</code>
<dd>(<code>enumerated-in-file</code>) The class of a problem in a default
<small>GNATS</small> installation can be one of the following:

<dl>
<dt><code>sw-bug</code>
<dd>A general product problem.  (<code>sw</code> stands for "software".)

<br><dt><code>doc-bug</code>
<dd>A problem with the documentation.

<br><dt><code>change-request</code>
<dd>A request for a change in behavior, etc.

<br><dt><code>support</code>
<dd>A support problem or question.

<br><dt><code>duplicate (<var>pr-number</var>)</code>
<dd>Duplicate PR.  <var>pr-number</var> should be the number of the original PR.

<br><dt><code>mistaken</code>
<dd>No problem, user error or misunderstanding.  This value can only be set
by tools at the Support Site, since it has no meaning for ordinary
submitters. 
</dl>

<p>See <a href="classes-file.html#classes%20file">The <code>classes</code> file</a>, for details.

<br><dt><code>Release</code>
<dd>(<code>text</code>) Release or version number of the product, component or
concept.

<br><dt><code>Environment</code>
<dd>(<code>multitext</code>) Description of the environment where the problem
occurred: machine architecture, operating system, host and target types,
libraries, pathnames, etc.

<br><dt><code>Description</code>
<dd>(<code>multitext</code>) Precise description of the problem.

<br><dt><code>How-To-Repeat</code>
<dd>(<code>multitext</code>) Example code, input, or activities to reproduce the
problem.  The support organization uses example code both to reproduce
the problem and to test whether the problem is fixed.  Include all
preconditions, inputs, outputs, conditions after the problem, and
symptoms.  Any additional important information should be included. 
Include all the details that would be necessary for someone else to
recreate the problem reported, however obvious.  Sometimes seemingly
arbitrary or obvious information can point the way toward a solution. 
See also <a href="Helpful-hints.html#Helpful%20hints">Helpful hints</a>.

<br><dt><code>Fix</code>
<dd>(<code>multitext</code>) A description of a solution to the problem, or a
patch which solves the problem.  (This field is most often filled in at
the Support Site; we provide it to the submitter in case he or she has
solved the problem.) 
</dl>

<p><small>GNATS</small> adds the following fields when the PR arrives at the Support
Site:

<dl>
<dt><code>Number</code>
<dd>(<code>enumerated</code>) The incremental identification number for this PR. 
This is included in the automated reply to the submitter (if that
feature of <small>GNATS</small> is activated; see <a href="dbconfig-file.html#dbconfig%20file">The <code>dbconfig</code> file</a>).  It is also included in the copy of the PR that
is sent to the maintainer.

<p>The <code>Number</code> field is often paired with the <code>Category</code> field
as

<br><pre><var>category</var>/<var>number</var>
</pre>

<p>in subsequent email messages.  This is <small>GNATS</small>' way of tracking
followup messages that arrive by mail so that they are filed as part of
the original PR.

<br><dt><code>State</code>
<dd>(<code>enumerated</code>) The current state of the PR.  In default <small>GNATS</small>
installations, accepted values are:

<dl>
<dt><code>open</code>
<dd>The PR has been filed and the responsible person notified.

<br><dt><code>analyzed</code>
<dd>The responsible person has analyzed the problem.

<br><dt><code>feedback</code>
<dd>The problem has been solved, and the originator has been given a patch
or other fix.  Support organizations may also choose to temporarily
"park" PRs that are awaiting further input from the submitter under
this state.

<br><dt><code>closed</code>
<dd>The changes have been integrated, documented, and tested, and the
originator has confirmed that the solution works.

<br><dt><code>suspended</code>
<dd>Work on the problem has been postponed. 
</dl>

<p>The initial state of a PR is <code>open</code>.  See <a href="States.html#States">States of Problem Reports</a>.

<br><dt><code>Responsible</code>
<dd>(<code>text</code>) The person at the Support Site who is responsible for this
PR. 
<small>GNATS</small> retrieves this information from the <code>categories</code> file
(see <a href="categories-file.html#categories%20file">The <code>categories</code> file</a>).

<br><dt><code>Arrival-Date</code>
<dd>(<code>date</code>) The time that this PR was received by <small>GNATS</small>.  The
date is provided automatically by <small>GNATS</small>.

<br><dt><code>Date-Required</code>
<dd>(<code>date</code>) The date by which a fix is required.  This is up to the
maintainers at the Support Site to determine, so this field is not
available until after the PR has been submitted.

<br><dt><code>Audit-Trail</code>
<dd>(<code>multitext</code>) Tracks related electronic mail as well as changes in
the <code>State</code> and <code>Responsible</code> fields with the sub-fields:

<dl>
<dt><code>State-Changed-&lt;From&gt;-&lt;To&gt;:&nbsp;<var>oldstate</var>&gt;-&lt;<var>newstate</var></code>
<dd>The old and new <code>State</code> field values.

<br><dt><code>Responsible-Changed-&lt;From&gt;-&lt;To&gt;:&nbsp;<var>oldresp</var>&gt;-&lt;<var>newresp</var></code>
<dd>The old and new <code>Responsible</code> field values.

<br><dt><code>State-Changed-By: <var>name</var></code>
<dt><code>Responsible-Changed-By: <var>name</var></code>
<dd>The name of the maintainer who effected the change.

<br><dt><code>State-Changed-When: <var>timestamp</var></code>
<dt><code>Responsible-Changed-When: <var>timestamp</var></code>
<dd>The time the change was made.

<br><dt><code>State-Changed-Why: <var>reason<small>...</small></var></code>
<dt><code>Responsible-Changed-Why: <var>reason<small>...</small></var></code>
<dd>The reason for the change. 
</dl>

<p>The <code>Audit-Trail</code> field also contains any mail messages received by
<small>GNATS</small> related to this PR, in the order received.  <small>GNATS</small> needs
to find a <var>category</var>/<var>number</var> at the beginning of the Subject
field of received e-mail in order to be able to file it correctly.

<br><dt><code>Unformatted</code>
<dd>(<code>multitext</code>) Any random text found outside the fields in the
original Problem Report. 
</dl>

<p>During a Problem Report's journey from <code>open</code> to <code>closed</code>, two
more fields, <code>Last-Modified</code> and <code>Closed Date</code> (both of type
<code>date</code>) will be added.
