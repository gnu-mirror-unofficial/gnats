<h3>Upgrading from older versions</h3>

<p>The following procedure covers an upgrade from all <small>GNATS</small> 3 versions
newer than 3.108.  If your installation is an older 3.10x version, or
even the ancient 3.2 version, you need to review the
<code>UPGRADING.old</code> file in the <small>GNATS</small> distribution before carrying
out the steps detailed here.

<h4>Overview</h4>

<p>Although almost all of the <small>GNATS</small> internals have been redesigned and
rewritten for <small>GNATS</small> 4, little has changed in the format and
structure of the database data.  The only change that needs to be taken
into account when upgrading is the fact that the database index format
is binary in a default installation of <small>GNATS</small> 4.  Thus, you will
need to regenerate your database index by using the <code>gen-index</code>
tool.  In addition, if your old <small>GNATS</small> installation was so-called
"release-based", you need to make some simple modifications to the
database setup file <code>dbconfig</code>.  See below for details.

<p>Apart from building and installing new binaries, the major changes which
impinge on the upgrade procedure are all on the configuration side.  The
main database configuration file, <code>dbconfig</code>, is far more complex
and powerful than the old <code>config</code> file, and while the installation
process creates a sensible set of default values which are similar to
<small>GNATS</small> 3.11x's defaults, you still need to migrate any changes you
may have made to your own local configuration.

<p>Another aspect which needs consideration are remote submitter sites. 
Such sites either need to be instructed to upgrade their locally
installed copies of the <small>GNATS</small> user tools (<code>send-pr</code>,
<code>edit-pr</code> and <code>query-pr</code>), or they should be given access
through interfaces such as Gnatsweb.

<p>Since the <small>GNATS</small> network daemon has been completely reworked, with
an entirely new command set, all network-based interfaces, such as
Gnatsweb and TkGnats need to be upgraded to versions that support
<small>GNATS</small> 4.  The <code>contrib</code> directory of this distribution
contains some third-party interfaces, and the <code>README</code> file
contains pointers to where you can obtain the newest versions of these
tools.

<p>This document only deals with upgrading <small>GNATS</small> itself.  Third-party
tools should have separate upgrading instructions in their
distributions.

<h4>Upgrading</h4>

<ol type=1 start=1>
</p><li>Before you begin, make a backup of your entire <small>GNATS</small> database
directory hierarchy, the <small>GNATS</small> executables directory and the
<small>GNATS</small> user tools (<code>send-pr</code>, <code>query-pr</code> etc.)  The
locations of these may vary, but in a default <small>GNATS</small> 3 installation,
the database(s) reside under <code>/usr/local/share/gnats</code>, the
executables are located in <code>/usr/local/libexec/gnats</code> and the
user tools reside in <code>/usr/local/bin</code>.

<li>(optional) In order to avoid confusing your users, you may want to
remove the old <small>GNATS</small> 3 executables and tools, escpecially if you
plan to install <small>GNATS</small> 4 in a different location than version 3.

<li>Build and install <small>GNATS</small> 4.  See <a href="Installation.html#Installation">Installing <small>GNATS</small></a>.  It is recommended that you use the
<code>--with-gnats-default-db</code> option when running <code>configure</code>,
in order to set the default database to be one of your already existing
<small>GNATS</small> 3 databases.

<li>Edit the <small>GNATS</small> <code>databases</code> file and add entries for all your
old <small>GNATS</small> 3 databases.  In a default <small>GNATS</small> 4 installation
the file is in <code>/usr/local/etc/gnats</code>.  See <a href="databases-file.html#databases%20file">The <code>databases</code> file</a>.

<li>In <small>GNATS</small> 3, the file <code>gnatsd.conf</code> specifies minimum access
levels for the different hosts accessing the <small>GNATS</small> daemon,
<code>gnatsd</code>.  There is one <code>gnatsd.conf</code> for each database.  In
<small>GNATS</small> 4, these files have been replaced by a single file named
<code>gnatsd.host_access</code> which contains settings that apply across all
the databases on the server.  This file is located in the same directory
as the <code>databases</code> file.  You need to combine the host access
settings from all your <small>GNATS</small> 3 databases and add them to the
<code>gnatsd.host_access</code> file.  Note that you are no longer able to
control host access on a per-database basis.  Optionally, you may delete
the old <code>gnatsd.conf</code> files.  See <a href="Access-Control.html#Access%20Control">Controlling access to <small>GNATS</small> databases</a>.

<li>Next, you need to migrate the settings in the old <code>config</code> files of
your databases to corresponding <code>dbconfig</code> files.  The database you
specified with the <code>--with-gnats-default-db</code> configure option
got a default <code>dbconfig</code> installed.  This default file contains
field definitions etc. which makes this version of <small>GNATS</small> behave
almost exactly like older versions.  Copy this default file to the
<code>gnats-adm</code> directories of any other <small>GNATS</small> databases that
you may have on your host before you proceed to migrate your old
configuration settings.

<p>The following is a list of the configuration directives that may be
present in a <code>config</code> file and their counterparts (if any) in
<small>GNATS</small> 4.

<dl>
<dt><var>GNATS_ADDR</var>
<dd>This setting has no counterpart in <small>GNATS</small> 4, since <small>GNATS</small> no
longer needs to know its own mail address.

<br><dt><var>GNATS_ADMIN</var>
<dd>This setting is now set in the <code>responsible</code> file in the
<code>gnats-adm</code> directory of your database(s).

<br><dt><var>GNATS_SITE</var>
<dd><small>GNATS</small> 4 has no concept of a named `site', so this directive is
obsolete.

<br><dt><var>SUBMITTER</var>
<dd>Obsolete, since it relates to <var>GNATS_SITE</var>.

<br><dt><var>DEFAULT_RELEASE</var>
<dt><var>DEFAULT_ORGANIZATION</var>
<dd>The <small>GNATS</small> 4 <code>dbconfig</code> file has separate configuration
sections for each defined field.  Field defaults are set with the
<code>default</code> keyword in these sections.  See <a href="dbconfig-file.html#dbconfig%20file">The <code>dbconfig</code> file</a>.

<br><dt><var>NOTIFY</var>
<dd>Controlled by the <code>notify-about-expired-prs</code> setting in the
<code>dbconfig</code> file.

<br><dt><var>ACKNOWLEDGE</var>
<dd>Controlled by the <code>send-submitter-ack</code> setting in the
<code>dbconfig</code> file.

<br><dt><var>DEFAULT_SUBMITTER</var>
<dd>The default submitter is now always the first entry in the
<code>submitters</code> file of your database.

<br><dt><var>KEEP_RECEIVED_HEADERS</var>
<dd>Controlled by the <code>keep-all-received-headers</code> setting in the
<code>dbconfig</code> file.

<br><dt><var>DEBUG_MODE</var>
<dd>Controlled by the <code>debug-mode</code> setting in the <code>dbconfig</code> file.

<br><dt><var>BDAY_START</var>
<dt><var>BDAY_END</var>
<dt><var>BWEEK_START</var>
<dt><var>BWEEK_END</var>
<dd>Controlled by the settings <code>business-day-hours</code> and
<code>business-week-days</code> in the <code>dbconfig</code> file.

<br><dt><var>DEFINE_CATEGORY</var>
<dd>The default category for PRs that arrive without one is now the first
category listed in the <code>categories</code> file of your database. 
</dl>

<p>After your are done migrating the settings, you may optionally delete
the old <code>config</code> files.  Since there are many more configuration
settings available in the <small>GNATS</small> 4 <code>dbconfig</code> file, you should
take some time to review them all before proceeding.  See <a href="dbconfig-file.html#dbconfig%20file">The <code>dbconfig</code> file</a>.

<p>If your old <small>GNATS</small> installations was release-based, i.e. it included
the fields Quarter, Keywords and Date-Required, you need to define those
fields in the <code>dbconfig</code> file by following the instructions in
<a href="release-based-support.html#release-based%20support">Supporting old <small>GNATS</small> "release-based" fields</a>.

</p><li>The file <code>gnatsd.access</code> has been renamed to <code>gnatsd.user_access</code>. 
Furthermore, <small>GNATS</small> 4 uses a different password format in the
<code>gnatsd.user_access</code> file than older versions, since it supports
<code>crypt()</code> and MD5 passwords (see <a href="Access-Control.html#Access%20Control">Controlling access to <small>GNATS</small> databases</a>).  You need to translate your old
<code>gnatsd.user_access</code> files to the new format by using the
<code>gnats-pwconv</code> tool which was installed in the
<code><var>EXEC-PREFIX</var>/libexec/gnats</code> directory, typically
<code>/usr/local/libexec/gnats</code>.  See <a href="gnats-pwconv.html#gnats-pwconv">Managing user passwords</a>.

<li>The final step involves regenerating the indexes of your databases.  For
this, log in as the user <code>gnats</code>.  Then run the <code>gen-index</code>
command for each of your databases.  See <a href="Admin-utils.html#Admin%20utils">Administrative Utilities</a> for details on how to use
<code>gen-index</code>.

<li>Sit back and enjoy your new <small>GNATS</small> 4 setup...
