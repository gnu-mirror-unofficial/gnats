<h3>The <code>databases</code> file</h3>

<p>The <code>databases</code> configuration file is a site-wide configuration
file containing the list of <small>GNATS</small> databases that are available
either on the host itself or remotely over the network, together with
some parameters associated with each database.

<p>The file contains one line for each database. For databases located on
the host itself, each line consists of three fields separated by colons:

<p><var>database name:short description of database:path/to/database</var>

<p>The first field is the database name.  This is the name used to identify
the database when invoking programs such as <code>query-pr</code> or
<code>send-pr</code>, either by using the <code>--database</code> option of the
program or by setting the <var>GNATSDB</var> environment variable to the name
of the database.  The second field is a short human-readable description
of the database contents, and the final field is the directory where the
database contents are kept.

<p>For a database that is located across a network, but which should be
accessible from this host, the entry for the database should look
like this:

<p><var>database name:short description of database::hostname:port</var>

<p>The first two fields are the same as for local databases, the third
field is empty (notice the two adjacent <code>:</code> symbols, indicating an
empty field), the fourth field is the hostname of the remote <small>GNATS</small>
server, and the fifth field is the port number that the remote
<small>GNATS</small> is running on.

<p>If <small>GNATS</small> was built with default options, the <code>databases</code> file
will be located in the <code>/usr/local/etc/gnats</code> directory. 
However, if the option <code>--with-gnats-dblist-file</code> was used during building
of <small>GNATS</small>, the <code>databases</code> file has the name and location given
to this option.  A sample <code>databases</code> file is installed together
with <small>GNATS</small>.

<p>Note that if you add a new local database, you must create its data
directory, including appropriate subdirectories and administrative
files.  This is best done using the <code>mkdb</code> tool, See <a href="mkdb.html#mkdb">mkdb</a>.
