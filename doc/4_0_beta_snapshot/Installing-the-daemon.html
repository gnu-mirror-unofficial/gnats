<h3>Installing the daemon</h3>

<p>By default, the daemon and clients are set to use port 1529.  Add the line

<br><pre>support		1529/tcp			# GNATS
</pre>

<p>to your <code>/etc/services</code> file.  If you want a different service
name, configure <small>GNATS</small> with

<br><pre>--with-gnats-service=<var>servicename</var>
</pre>

<p>In your <code>inetd.conf</code> file, add the line

<br><pre>support	stream	tcp	nowait	gnats	/usr/local/libexec/gnats/gnatsd gnatsd
</pre>

<p>adjusting the path accordingly if you used configure options to make
changes to the defaults.  To make <code>inetd</code> start spawning the
<small>GNATS</small> daemon when connected on that port, send it a hangup signal
(<code>HUP</code>).

<p>Some operating systems have replaced <code>inetd</code> with the more modern
<code>xinetd</code>. Instead of editing <code>inetd.conf</code>, you should create
the file <code>/etc/xinetd.d/support</code>, containing something like the
following:

<br><pre>service support
{
   disable = no
   socket_type = stream
   protocol = tcp
   wait = no
   user = gnats
   server = /usr/local/libexec/gnats/gnatsd
}
</pre>

<p>If you specified a different service name when running <code>configure</code>,
you need to give the file the same name as the service name, and you
need to adjust the <code>service</code> line above.  If the <code>--prefix</code> or
<code>--exec-prefix</code> options were passed to <code>configure</code>, adjust the
<code>server</code> line above, and if you used the <code>--with-gnats-user</code>
option, adjust the <code>user</code> line.

<p>Then restart <code>xinetd</code> to make the new configuration current.

<p>If you use an Internet superserver different from <code>inetd</code> or
<code>xinetd</code>, please refer to its documentation for information how
to configure it.

<p>At this point, you will probably want to set the access permissions of
the different hosts that are going to be accessing your databases.  The
access permissions can currently only be set on a global scale (that is,
across all the databases on a <small>GNATS</small> server).  The location and name
of the global host access configuration file can be set during the
pre-build configure as shown above, but by default the file is
<code>/usr/local/etc/gnats/gnatsd_host.access</code>.  It lists the hosts
allowed to access your server, and what their default access levels are. 
Each line in the file denotes one server, or one part of a network
domain.  There are three fields on each line, but only two are currently
used.  To grant all hosts from the domain <var>site.com</var> edit access,
use this line:

<p><var>site.com</var>:<var>edit</var>

<p>If you run a <small>GNATS</small> web interface or similar tool on the same
machine as the server is running on, you probably want to grant
<var>localhost</var> edit access:

<p><var>localhost</var>:<var>edit</var>

<p>If you are using Kerberos, the <code>gnatsd_host.access</code> file shows the
sites that don't require Kerberos authentication.

<p>The third field might in the future be used for things like controlling
what categories, submitter-id's PRs, etc., can be accessed from that
site.  Access attempts that are denied are logged to the syslog messages
file (<code>/var/adm/messages</code> on many systems).
