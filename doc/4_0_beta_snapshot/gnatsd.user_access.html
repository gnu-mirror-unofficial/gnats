<h3>Access levels per user</h3>

<p>Access levels per user can be set both across all databases on the
server or on a per-database basis.  The <code>gnatsd.user_access</code> file
in a database's <code>gnats-adm</code> directory specifies the user access
rules for that database.  If it doesn't exist, or doesn't contain the
user name given to <code>gnatsd</code>, then the overall user access file
(by default <code>/usr/local/etc/gnats/gnatsd.user_access</code>)
specifying the per-user access levels across all the databases on the
server is checked.

<p>The user access files can only <em>increase</em> the access level
defined in the host access files for the given host, they can never
lower it.

<p>If the access level is <code>none</code> after processing the userid and
password, the connection is closed.

<p>The <code>gnatsd.user_access</code> files can contain plain text passwords, in
such a case they should be owned by the <small>GNATS</small> user with file
permission 600.

<p>Wildcard characters are supported for the userid and password with
plain text passwords.  A null string or <code>*</code> matches anything;
<code>?</code> matches any one character.

<p>Entries in the database-specific <code>gnatsd.user_access</code> user access file
in the <code>gnats-adm</code> directory of the database have the following
general format:

<p><var>userid:password:access-level</var>

<p>The overall <code>gnatsd.user_access</code> user access file adds a fourth
<var>databases</var> field:

<p><var>userid:password:access-level:databases</var>

<p><var>password</var> should either be in plain text, DES
<code>crypt()</code><a rel=footnote href="#fn-1"><sup>1</sup></a> or MD5 hash format<a rel=footnote href="#fn-2"><sup>2</sup></a>.

<p>If the password is in plain text format, it must be prefixed by
<code>$0$</code> and if it is in MD5 format, it needs to be prefixed by the
string <code>$1$</code>.<a rel=footnote href="#fn-3"><sup>3</sup></a> Passwords encrypted by <code>crypt()</code> should have no
prefix. If no password is given then users can login with an empty
password string.

<p>A <code>gnats-passwd</code> tool to manage <code>gnatsd.user_access</code> files is
planned.  In the meantime, <code>crypt()</code> passwords can be generated by
using standard UNIX passwords tools, while MD5 passwords can be
generated with the following little Perl snippet:

<br><pre>perl -e 'use Crypt::PasswdMD5 ; print Crypt::PasswdMD5::unix_md5_crypt
"<var>password</var>" , time() % 100000000'
</pre>

<p>If your Perl installation doesn't have the Crypt module
installed, you need to install it.  On most systems, the following
command achieves this:

<br><pre>perl -MCPAN -e 'install Crypt::PasswdMD5'
</pre>

<p>A tool for conversion of pre-version 4 <code>gnatsd.user_access</code> files is
distributed with <small>GNATS</small> 4.  See <a href="gnats-pwconv.html#gnats-pwconv">Converting old password files</a>.

<p>The <var>access-level</var> field should contain one of the values listed at
the beginning of this appendix.  This overrides (increases but never
lowers) the access level given as the default for the user's host in the
global gnatsd.host_access file.

<p>The following shows an example <code>gnatsd.user_access</code> file with
plain text passwords:

<br><pre>rickm:$0$ruckm:edit
pablo:$0$pueblo:view
*::none
</pre>

<p>And this is the same file with MD5-encrypted passwords:
<br><pre>rickm:$1$92388613$D7ZIYikzTUqd./dODTFrI.:edit
pablo:$1$92388652$QRfAhIBG5elT.FQjQKhj80:view
*::none
</pre>

<p>In these examples, anybody other than rickm and pablo get
denied access, assuming that the host access level is also <code>none</code>. 
You could set the catch-all rule at the end to be <code>*::view</code> to
allow view access to anyone who does not supply a password.  Note the
important detail that such a rule would allow view access only to
persons who do not supply a password at all, i.e. if rickm or pablo tries
to log in but mistypes his password, this rule would not apply and
they would be denied access entirely.  This is by design, since people
might be surprised if they suddenly found themselves logged in, but with
a lower access level than they usually have.

<p>The <var>databases</var> field contains a comma-separated list of database
names, as defined in the <code>databases</code> file (see <a href="databases-file.html#databases%20file">The <code>databases</code> file</a>.  Wildcard characters are
supported. The databases listed in this field are the ones to which
the other settings on the same line will be applied.

<hr><h4>Footnotes</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><a name="fn-1"></a>
<p>DES crypt is the standard password encryption
format used by most UNIX systems</p>

<li><a name="fn-2"></a>
<p>MD5 is
only supported on platforms that have a <code>crypt()</code> function that
supports MD5. Among others, this currently includes <small>GNU</small> Linux and
OpenBSD.</p>

<li><a name="fn-3"></a>
<p>Some systems support even more encryption
methods.  In FreeBSD, for instance, a prefix of <code>$2$</code> implies
Blowfish encoding.  <small>GNATS</small> will happily accept any encryption that
the OS supports.</p>
