<h4>The Problem Report template</h4>

<p>Invoking <code>send-pr</code> presents a PR <dfn>template</dfn> with a number of
fields already filled in with default values for the database you are
submitting to.  Complete the template as thoroughly as possible to
make a useful bug report.  Submit only one bug with each PR.

<p>A template consists of three sections:

<ul>
<li>Comments
<li>Mail Header
<li><small>GNATS</small> fields
</ul>

<p>The <strong>Comments section</strong> at the top of the template contains basic
instructions for completing the Problem Report, as well as a list of
valid entries for the <code>Category</code> field.  One (and only one) of
these values should be placed in the <code>Category</code> field further down
in the Problem Report.

<br><pre>SEND-PR: -*- send-pr  -*-
SEND-PR: Lines starting with `SEND-PR' will be removed
SEND-PR: automatically as well as all comments (the text
SEND-PR: below enclosed in `&lt;' and `&gt;').
SEND-PR:
SEND-PR: Please consult the document `Reporting Problems
SEND-PR: Using send-pr' if you are not sure how to fill out
SEND-PR: a problem report.
SEND-PR:
SEND-PR: Choose from the following categories:
</pre>

<p>The comments lines are all preceded by the string <code>SEND-PR:</code> and
are erased automatically when the PR is submitted.  The instructional
comments within <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> are also removed.  (Only these
comments are removed; lines you provide that happen to have those
characters in them, such as examples of shell-level redirection, are not
affected.)

<p>The <strong>Mail Header</strong> section of the template contains a standard
mail header constructed by <code>send-pr</code>.  <code>send-pr</code> can be set up
to submit PRs by e-mail or by speaking directly to the <small>GNATS</small>
server, but since this header is part of the standard format of Problem
Reports, <code>send-pr</code> includes it even when it is set up to speak
directly to the server.

<br><pre>To: <var>PR submission address</var>
Subject: <em>complete this field</em>
From: <var>your-login</var>@<var>your-site</var>
Reply-To: <var>your-login</var>@<var>your-site</var>
X-send-pr-version: send-pr 4.0-prebeta2
</pre>

<p><code>send-pr</code> automatically completes all the mail header fields except
the <code>Subject</code> line with default values.  (See <a href="Fields.html#Fields">Problem Report format</a>.)

<p>The <strong><small>GNATS</small> fields</strong> below the mail header form the bulk of a
<small>GNATS</small> Problem Report.

<p>Each field is either automatically completed with valid information
(such as your <code>Submitter-Id</code>) or contains a one-line instruction
specifying the information that field requires in order to be correct. 
For example, the <code>Confidential</code> field expects a value of <code>yes</code>
or <code>no</code>, and the answer must fit on one line; similarly, the
<code>Synopsis</code> field expects a short synopsis of the problem, which
must also fit on one line.  Fill out the fields as completely as
possible.  See <a href="Helpful-hints.html#Helpful%20hints">Helpful hints</a>, for suggestions as to
what kinds of information to include.

<p>The mechanisms <code>send-pr</code> uses to fill in default values is as
follows: Your preconfigured <code>Submitter-Id</code> is taken from the local
<code>send-pr.conf</code> configuration file.  <code>send-pr</code> will set the
<code>Originator</code> field to the value of the <code>NAME</code> environment
variable if it has been set; similarly, <code>Organization</code> will be set
to the value of <code>ORGANIZATION</code>.  If these variables aren't set in
you environment, <code>send-pr</code> uses the values set in the local
<code>send-pr.conf</code> configuration file, if that exists.  If not, these
values are left blank in the template.  <code>send-pr</code> also attempts to
find out some information about your system and architecture, and places
this information in the <code>Environment</code> field if it finds any.

<p>In this example, words in <em>italics</em> are filled in with
pre-configured information:

<br><pre>&gt;Submitter-Id: <em>your submitter-id</em>
&gt;Originator:   <em>your name here</em>
&gt;Organization:
    <em>your organization</em>
&gt;Confidential:&lt;[ yes | no ] (one line)&gt;
&gt;Synopsis:    &lt;synopsis of the problem (one line)&gt;
&gt;Severity:    &lt;[non-critical | serious | critical](one line)&gt;
&gt;Priority:    &lt;[ low | medium | high ] (one line)&gt;
&gt;Category:    &lt;name of the product (one line)&gt;
&gt;Class:       &lt;[sw-bug | doc-bug | change-request | support]&gt;
&gt;Release:     &lt;release number (one line)&gt;
&gt;Environment:
         &lt;machine, os, target, libraries (multiple lines)&gt;

&gt;Description:
       &lt;precise description of the problem (multiple lines)&gt;
&gt;How-To-Repeat:
       &lt;code/input/activities to reproduce (multiple lines)&gt;
&gt;Fix:
       &lt;how to correct or work around the problem, if known
        (multiple lines)&gt;
</pre>

<p>When you finish editing the Problem Report, <code>send-pr</code> validates the
contents and if it looks OK either submits it directly to the
<small>GNATS</small> server or submits it by mail to the address named in the
<code>To</code> field in the mail header.

<p>If your PR contains one or more invalid field values, <code>send-pr</code>
places the PR in a temporary file named <code>/tmp/pbad<var>nnnn</var></code> on
your machine.  <var>nnnn</var> is the process identification number given
to your current <code>send-pr</code> session.  If you are running
<code>send-pr</code> from the shell, you are prompted as to whether or not
you wish to try editing the same Problem Report again.  If you are
running <code>send-pr</code> from Emacs, the Problem Report is placed in the
buffer <code>*gnats-send*</code>; you can edit this file and then submit
it with <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd>.

<p>Any further mail concerning this Problem Report should be carbon-copied
to the <small>GNATS</small> mailing address as well, with the category and
identification number in the <code>Subject</code> line of the message.

<br><pre>Subject: Re: PR <var>category</var>/<var>gnats-id</var>: <var>original message subject</var>
</pre>

<p>Messages which arrive with <code>Subject</code> lines of this form are
automatically appended to the Problem Report in the <code>Audit-Trail</code>
field in the order they are received.
