<h4>Mail header fields</h4>

<p>A Problem Report may contain any mail header field described in the
Internet standard RFC-822.  The <code>send-pr</code> tool can be configured
either to submit PRs to the support site by e-mail or by talking
directly to the <code>gnatsd</code> network daemon on the <small>GNATS</small> server. 
This is also true for other client tools such as Gnatsweb.  Even when
these tools are set up submit PRs directly to <code>gnatsd</code>, they will
still include mail header fields that identify the sender and the
subject in the submitted PR:

<dl>
<dt><code>To:</code>
<dd>The mail address for the Support Site, automatically supplied by the
tool used to submit the PR or by the originator if plain e-mail was
used.

<br><dt><code>Subject:</code>
<dd>A terse description of the problem.  This field normally contains the
same information as the <code>Synopsis</code> field.

<br><dt><code>From:</code>
<dd>Supplied automatically when PRs are submitted by plain e-mail and when
well-behaved tools such as <code>send-pr</code> are used; should always
contain the originator's e-mail address.

<br><dt><code>Reply-To:</code>
<dd>A return address to which electronic replies can be sent; in most cases,
the same address as the <code>From:</code> field. 
</dl>

<p>One of the configurable options for <small>GNATS</small> is whether or not to
retain <code>Received-By</code> headers, which often consume a lot of
space and are not often used.  See <a href="dbconfig-file.html#dbconfig%20file">The dbconfig file</a>.
