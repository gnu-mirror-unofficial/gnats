<h2>Introducing <small>GNATS</small></h2>

<p>Any support organization realizes that a large amount of data flows back
and forth between the maintainers and the users of their products.  This
data often takes the form of problem reports and communication via
electronic mail.  <small>GNATS</small> addresses the problem of organizing this
communication by defining a database made up of archived and indexed
problem reports.

<p><small>GNATS</small> was designed as a tool for software maintainers.  It consists
of several utilities which, when used in concert, formulate and
administer a database of Problem Reports grouped by site-defined
<dfn>problem categories</dfn>.  It allows a support organization to keep
track of problems (hence the term <dfn>Problem Report</dfn>) in an organized
fashion.  Essentially, <small>GNATS</small> acts as an active archive for
field-separated textual data.
