<h4>The <code>index</code> file</h4>

<p>The index is used to accelerate searches on the database by
<code>query-pr</code> and <code>edit-pr</code>.  This file is not created until the
first PR comes in.  It is then kept up to date by <small>GNATS</small>; you should
never touch this file.

<p>Searches on subjects contained in the index are much faster than
searches which depend on data not in the index.  Inexes come in two
different formats: <dfn>binary</dfn> and <dfn>plain-text</dfn>.  Binary indexes
are safer, in that they avoid certain problems that may crop up if the
field separators used by plain-text indexes appear in field data.

<p>A plain-text index contains single-line entries for all PR fields
except for the multitext fields such as Description, How-To-Repeat,
etc. Fields are separated by bars (<code>|</code>) except for
<code>Category</code> and <code>Number</code>, which are separated by a slash
(<code>/</code>).

<p>Binary indexes are not meant to be human-readable, but they are safer
than the plain-text variety, in that they avoid certain problems that may
crop up if the field separators used by plain-text indexes appear in
field data.

<p>The format of the index for a database is set in the <code>dbconfig</code>
file. See <a href="Index-file-description.html#Index%20file%20description">Index file description</a>.

<p>Should the <code>index</code> file become corrupted, the <code>gen-index</code>
utility can be used to regenerate it. See <a href="gen-index.html#gen-index">Regenerating the index</a>.
