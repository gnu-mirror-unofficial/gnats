<h4>Other commands</h4>

<dl>
<dt><kbd>M-x unlock-pr</kbd>
<dd>Ask for a Problem Report number and unlock that Problem Report.  This
function is useful if connection to a <small>GNATS</small> server was
interrupted during an editing operation and further modifications of
the Problem Report are blocked by a stealth lock.

<br><dt><kbd>M-x unlock-database</kbd>
<dd>Unlock the whole <small>GNATS</small> database.  This function is useful in
situations similar to when <code>unlock-pr</code> is used.

<br><dt><kbd>M-x gnats-show-connection</kbd>
<dd>Show the connection buffer associated with the current buffer.  You
can view the Emacs communication with <small>GNATSD</small> in it.  This is
useful when something strange happens during the communication with
the server, e.g. when sending a Problem Report with <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> from
a Problem Report editing buffer.
