<h3>Editing existing Problem Reports</h3>

<p>Use <code>edit-pr</code> to make changes to existing PRs in the database. 
This tool can be invoked both from a shell prompt or from within GNU
Emacs using <code>M-x edit-pr</code>.

<p><code>edit-pr</code> first examines the PR you wish to edit and locks it if it
is not already locked.  This is to prevent you from editing a PR at the
same time as another user.  If the PR you wish to edit is already in the
process of being edited, <code>edit-pr</code> tells you the name of the person
who owns the lock.

<p>You may edit any non-readonly fields in the database.  We recommend that
you avoid deleting any information in the <small>TEXT</small> and <small>MULTITEXT</small>
fields (such as <code>Description</code> and <code>How-To-Repeat</code>
(see <a href="Fields.html#Fields">Problem Report format</a>).  We also recommend that you
record the final solution to the problem in the <code>Fix</code> field for
future reference.  Note that heavily customized installations of
<small>GNATS</small> may have differently named fields, and sites using such
installations should provide their own set of routines and instructions
regarding how PRs should be treated throughout their life span.

<p>After the PR has been edited, it is then resubmitted to the database,
and the index is updated (see <a href="index-file.html#index%20file">The <code>index</code> file</a>). 
For information on <code>pr-edit</code>, the main driver for <code>edit-pr</code>,
see <a href="Internal-utils.html#Internal%20utils">Internal utilities</a>.

<p>If you change a field that requires a reason for the change, such as the
<code>Responsible</code> or <code>State</code> fields in the default configuration,
<code>edit-pr</code> prompts you to supply a reason for the change.  A message
is then appended to the <code>Audit-Trail</code> field of the PR with the
changed values and the change reason.

<p>Depending on how the database is configured, editing various fields in
the PR may also cause mail to be sent concerning these changes.  In the
default configuration, any fields that generate <code>Audit-Trail</code>
entries will also cause a copy of the new <code>Audit-Trail</code> message to
be sent.
