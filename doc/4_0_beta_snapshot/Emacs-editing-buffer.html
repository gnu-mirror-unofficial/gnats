<h4>The Problem Report editing buffer</h4>

<p>When you invoke a Problem Report editing command, the Problem Report
is put into a special editing buffer.  The Problem Report is formatted
similarly to the <code>query-pr -F</code> output, <a href="Formatting-query-pr-output.html#Formatting%20query-pr%20output">Formatting query-pr output</a>.  Field identifiers are formatted as

<br><pre>&gt;Field:
</pre>

<p>with the text of the field following the identifier on the same line
for single-line fields or starting on the next line for multi-line
fields.

<p>The Problem Report editing mode tries to prevent you from violating
the Problem Report format and the constraints put on the possible
field values.  Generally, you can use usual editing commands, some of
them have a slightly modified behavior though.  (If you encounter a
very strange behavior somewhere, please report it as a bug,
<a href="Support.html#Support">Support</a>.)

<p>You can move between fields easily by pressing the <kbd>TAB</kbd>
(<code>gnats-next-field</code>) or <kbd>M-TAB</kbd>
(<code>gnats-previous-field</code>) keys.

<p>The field tags are read-only and you cannot edit them nor delete them. 
If you want to "remove" a field, just make its value empty.

<p>Editing a field value depends on the type of the edited field,
<a href="Field-datatypes.html#Field%20datatypes">Field datatypes</a>.  For text fields, you can edit the value
directly, assuming you preserve the rule about single-line and
multi-line values mentioned above.

<p>For enumerated fields, you cannot edit the value directly.  You can
choose it from the list of the allowed values, either from the menu
popped up by pressing the middle mouse button or from within
minibuffer by pressing any key on the field's value.  If the pressed
key matches any of the allowed field values, that value is put as the
default value after the minibuffer prompt.  You can also cycle through
the allowed field values directly in the editing buffer using the
<code>SPACE</code> key.  Enumerated field values are marked by a special
face to not confuse you; you must have enabled font lock mode to
benefit from this feature, <a href="../emacs/Font-Lock.html#Font%20Lock">Font Lock</a>.

<p>Some field values can be read-only, you cannot edit them at all.

<p>Once you have edited the Problem Report as needed, you can send it to
the server with the <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> command
(<code>gnats-apply-or-submit</code>).  Successful submission is reported by
a message and the buffer modification flag in mode line is cleared. 
Then you can either kill the buffer or continue with further
modifications.
