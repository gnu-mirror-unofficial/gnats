<h4>Formatting <code>query-pr</code> output</h4>

<p>Printing formats for PRs are in one of three forms:

<dl>
<dt><var>formatname</var>
<dd>This is a named format which is described by the database (specifically,
these formats are described in the <code>dbconfig</code> file associated with the
database).  The default configuration contains five such formats:
<code>standard</code>, <code>full</code>, <code>summary</code>, <code>sql</code>, and
<code>sql2</code>.

<p>The first three are the ones most commonly used when performing queries. 
standard is the format used by default if no other format is specified.

<p>Use of the latter two are discouraged; they are merely kept for
historical purposes.  Other named formats may have been added by the
database administrator.

<br><dt><var>fieldname</var>
<dd>A single field name may appear here.  Only the contents of this field
will be displayed.

<br><dt><var>'"printf string" fieldname fieldname ...'</var>
<dd>This provides a very flexible mechanism for formatting PR output.  (The
formatting is identical to that provided by the named formats described
by the database configuration, See <a href="Named-query-definitions.html#Named%20query%20definitions">Named query definitions</a>.  The
<var>printf string</var> can contain the following % sequences:

<p><code>%[positionalspecifiers]s</code>: Prints the field as a string.  The
positional specifiers are similar to those of printf, as +, - and digit
qualifiers can be used to force a particular alignment of the field
contents.

<p><code>%[positionalspecifiers]S</code>: Similar to <code>%s</code>, except that the
field contents are terminated at the first space character.

<p><code>%[positionalspecifiers]d</code>: Similar to <code>%s</code>, except that the
field contents are written as a numeric value.  For integer fields, the
value is written as a number.  For enumerated fields, the field is
converted into a numeric equivalent (i.e. if the field can have two
possible values, the result will be either 1 or 2).  For date fields,
the value is written as seconds since Jan 1, 1970.

<p><code>%F</code>: The field is written as it would appear within a PR, complete
with field header.

<p><code>%D</code>: For date fields, the date is written in a standard <small>GNATS</small>
format.

<p><code>%Q</code>: For date fields, the date is written in an arbitrary "SQL"
format. 
</dl>

<p>An example formatted query looks as follows (note that the whole format
specification should be quoted):

<br><pre>query-pr --format '"%s, %s" Synopsis State'
</pre>
