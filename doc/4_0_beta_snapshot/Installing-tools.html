<h3>Installing the user tools</h3>

<p>When you install the <small>GNATS</small> utilities, the user tools
<code>send-pr</code>, <code>query-pr</code> and <code>edit-pr</code> are installed on the
server machine.  If your machine is part of a network, however, you may
wish to install the user tools on each machine in the network so that
responsible parties on those machines can submit new Problem Reports,
query the database, and edit existing PRs.  In the following discussion,
machines with the <small>GNATS</small> user tools installed are referred to as
<dfn>client</dfn> machines.  In general, there are three distinct types of
client that a <small>GNATS</small> server may have to cater for:

<ul>
<li>Machines that are on the same local network as the
<small>GNATS</small> server, i.e. machines that are under the same
administrative control.

<li>Machines on the general, open Internet.

<li>Machines behind firewalls etc. which deny direct access
over the network to the <small>GNATS</small> server. 
</ul>

<p>Each type of client requires a different approach when it comes to
providing access.

<h4>User tools on a local network</h4>

<p>If all the machines involved reside on the same local network as the
<small>GNATS</small> server, you can simply share out the directories on the
server that contain the user tools, by default <code>/usr/local/bin</code> and
the directory which contains the <code>send-pr.conf</code> configuration file
(see <a href="send-pr.conf-file.html#send-pr.conf%20file">The send-pr.conf configuration file</a>), by
default <code>/usr/local/etc/gnats</code>.  If you have a heterogeneous
environment, i.e. hosts running different operating systems, you need to
create several shared <small>GNATS</small> installations, one for each platform. 
The <code>send-pr.conf</code> file is platform-independent, though.

<p>In order to submit a new PR, <code>send-pr</code> would then be invoked as
follows on the client machines:

<br><pre>send-pr -d <var>hostname:port:database:username:password</var>
</pre>

<p>Or by first setting the environment variable <code>GNATSDB</code> as follows
(the exact syntax will vary depending on what shell you use):

<br><pre>export GNATSDB=<var>hostname:port:database:username:password</var>
</pre>

<p>Then, <code>send-pr</code> can simply be invoked without any options.

<p>The other tools, <code>query-pr</code> and <code>edit-pr</code>, work in similar
ways, honoring the <code>-d</code> option as well as the <code>GNATSDB</code>
environment variable.  See <a href="GNATS-user-tools.html#GNATS%20user%20tools">GNATS user tools</a>.

<h4>User tools for remote users</h4>

<p>When client machines reside on the general Internet, both security and
practical considerations may make it impossible to provide a shared
installation of the <small>GNATS</small> tools.  In this case, you may choose to
only provide access through a web interface such as Gnatsweb.  For
clients that need the <small>GNATS</small> tools, the following needs to be
carried out on the remote machines:

<ol type=1 start=1>
</p><li>Configure and build <small>GNATS</small> on the client machine

<li>Configure <code>send-pr</code> on the client machine
</ol>

<p>You should unpack the distribution and run <code>configure</code> on the
client machine in the same way as described in <a href="Configure-and-make.html#Configure%20and%20make">Configuring and compiling the software</a>.  Note, however, that you
do not need to create a <code>gnats</code> user on the client and you should
not use the <code>make all info</code> command to build.  Instead, issue the
following commands from the top level directory of the source
distribution:

<br><pre>cd gnats
make install-tools
cd ../send-pr
make all install
</pre>

<p>This builds and installs the <code>send-pr</code>, <code>query-pr</code> and
<code>edit-pr</code> tools on the client machine.  You should now configure
<code>send-pr</code> by editing the <code>send-pr.conf</code> file
(see <a href="send-pr.conf-file.html#send-pr.conf%20file">The send-pr.conf configuration file</a>.)

<p>Users on the client machine can now either use the send-pr syntax or the
<code>GNATSDB</code>environment variable described in the previous section.

<p>For sites that need to submit Problem Reports by having send-pr send
e-mail instead of speaking directly over the network to the <small>GNATS</small>
server, you need to create a problem report template on the <small>GNATS</small>
server and have that template copied to a suitable location on the
client machine (any filename and any location will do, as long as
<code>send-pr</code> on the client machine can read the file).  On the
<small>GNATS</small> server, use the command

<br><pre>send-pr -p &gt; <code>filename</code>
</pre>

<p>The file <code>filename</code> now contains a PR template for your database. 
Copy this file to the client.  Then edit the <code>send-pr.conf</code> file
that you created on the client, set the <code>TEMPLATE</code> variable to
point to the template file (see <a href="send-pr.conf-file.html#send-pr.conf%20file">The send-pr.conf configuration file</a>) and make sure that the <code>MAILPROG</code> and
<code>MAILADDR</code> varables in <code>send-pr.conf</code> are correctly set.  You
should now have a working remote tool installation.

<p>For clients that have no direct network access to your <small>GNATS</small>
server, such as those that are located behind strict firewalls, you
either need to set up a web interface such as Gnatsweb (provided that
the firewall lets web traffic through) or use the procedure above which
sets up <code>send-pr</code> to submit Problem Reports by e-mail.  In order to
query PRs, users on the remote machines will then have to use the the
e-mail functionality of <code>query-pr</code> (see <a href="Invoking-query-pr.html#Invoking%20query-pr">Invoking query-pr</a>. 
Editing PRs by e-mail is not possible, so clients in this group who need
edit access have to get access through a web interface if possible.

<p>Note that when <code>send-pr</code> is set up to work over e-mail, the
<code>GNATSDB</code> environment variable and the <code>-d</code> command line
option have no effect since <code>send-pr</code> is tied to a specific
database by way of the value of <code>MAILADDR</code> in the
<code>send-pr.conf</code> file.
