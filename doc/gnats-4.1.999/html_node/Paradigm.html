<h3 class="section">1.1 The database paradigm</h3>

<p><a name="index-paradigm-6"></a><a name="index-database-paradigm-7"></a><a name="index-why-GNATS-8"></a><a name="index-support-site-9"></a><a name="index-maintenance-10"></a><a name="index-so-what-does-it-do-11"></a>
It is in your best interest as the maintainer of a body of work to
organize the feedback you receive on that work, and to make it easy for
users of your work to report problems and suggestions.

   <p><span class="sc">gnats</span> makes this easy by automatically filing incoming problem
reports into appropriate places, by notifying responsible parties of the
existence of the problem and (optionally) sending an acknowledgment to
the submitter that the report was received, and by making these Problem
Reports accessible to queries and easily editable.  <span class="sc">gnats</span> is a
database specialized for a specific task.

   <p><span class="sc">gnats</span> was designed for use at a Support Site that handles a high
level of problem-related traffic.  It maintains Problem Reports in the
form of text files with defined <dfn>fields</dfn>
(see <a href="Fields.html#Fields"><span class="sc">gnats</span> data fields</a>).  The location of the database,
as well as the categories it accepts as valid, the maintainers for whom
it provides service, and the submitters from whom it accepts Problem
Reports, are all definable by the <dfn>Support Site</dfn>. 
See <a href="Management.html#Management"><span class="sc">gnats</span> administration</a>.

   <p><a name="index-what-is-a-PR-12"></a>Each PR is a separate file within a main repository
(see <a href="Locations.html#Locations">Where <span class="sc">gnats</span> lives</a>).  Editing access to the
database is regulated to maintain consistency.  To make queries on
the database faster, an index is kept automatically (see <a href="index-file.html#index-file">The <code>index</code> file</a>).

   <p>We provide several software tools so that users may submit new Problem
Reports, edit existing Problem Reports, and query the database.

     <ul>
<li><code>send-pr</code><!-- /@w --> is used by both product maintainers and the end users
of the products they support to submit PRs to the database.

     <li><code>edit-pr</code><!-- /@w --> is used by maintainers when editing problem
reports in the database.

     <li>Maintainers, managers and administrators can use <code>query-pr</code><!-- /@w --> to
make inquiries about individual PRs or groups of PRs.

   </ul>

   <p>Other interfaces to <span class="sc">gnats</span> include Gnatsweb, a web-based tool which
provides features for submitting and editing PRs and querying the
database, and TkGnats, a Tcl/Tk-based frontend.  These tools are
distributed together with <span class="sc">gnats</span>.

   <p><a name="index-GNATS-administrator-13"></a>At the Support Site, a <span class="sc">gnats</span> <dfn>administrator</dfn> is charged with the
duty of maintaining <span class="sc">gnats</span>.  These duties are discussed in detail in
<a href="Management.html#Management"><span class="sc">gnats</span> Administration</a>, and generally include
configuring <span class="sc">gnats</span> for the Support Site, editing PRs that <span class="sc">gnats</span>
cannot process, pruning log files, setting up new problem categories,
backing up the database, and distributing <code>send-pr</code> so that others
may submit Problem Reports.

   <p>Responsibility for a given Problem Report initially depends on the
category of the problem.  Optionally, an automated reminder can be
sent to the responsible person if a problem report is neglected for a
requisite time period.  See <a href="GNATS-configuration.html#GNATS-configuration">Overview of <span class="sc">gnats</span> configuration</a>.

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bpending_007d-directory-14"></a><a name="index-unparseable-incoming-PRs-15"></a><a name="index-incoming-PRs-that-_0040sc_007bgnats_007d-cannot-parse-16"></a><span class="sc">gnats</span> does not have the ability to decipher random text. 
If there is no default category set, any
problem reports which arrive in a format <span class="sc">gnats</span> does not recognize
are placed in a separate directory pending investigation by the
<span class="sc">gnats</span> administrator (see <a href="Management.html#Management"><span class="sc">gnats</span> Administration</a>).

   <p>Once a problem is recorded in the database, work can begin toward a
solution.  A problem's initial <dfn>state</dfn> type is <dfn>open</dfn>
(see <a href="States.html#States">States of Problem Reports</a>).  An acknowledgment may be
sent to the originator of the bug report (depending on whether this
feature has been switched on in the <span class="sc">gnats</span> configuration). 
<span class="sc">gnats</span> forwards copies of the report to the party responsible for
that problem category and to the person responsible for problems
arriving from that submitter. 
<!-- (@pxref{Glossary,,Glossary}). -->

   <p>When a problem has been identified, the maintainer can change its state
to <dfn>analyzed</dfn>, and then to <dfn>feedback</dfn> when a solution is found. 
<span class="sc">gnats</span> may be configured so that each time the state of a PR
changes, the submitter of the problem report is notified of the reason
for the change.  If the party responsible for the PR changes, the
previous responsible party and the new responsible party receive notice
of the change.  The change and reason are also recorded in the
<code>Audit-Trail</code> field of the Problem Report.  (See <a href="edit_002dpr.html#edit_002dpr">Editing existing Problem Reports</a>.  For information on the <code>Audit-Trail</code>
field, see <a href="Fields.html#Fields">Problem Report format</a>.)

   <p>When the originator of the Problem Report confirms that the solution
works, the maintainer can change the state to <dfn>closed</dfn>.  If the PR
cannot be closed, the maintainer can change its state to <dfn>suspended</dfn>
as a last resort.  (For a more detailed description of the standard
states, see <a href="States.html#States">States of Problem Reports</a>.)

   <p>It should be emphasized that what we describe here is the default way
that <span class="sc">gnats</span> works, but as of version 4, <span class="sc">gnats</span> is extremely
customizable, allowing sites to tailor almost every aspect of its
behavior.  See for instance <a href="dbconfig-file.html#dbconfig-file">The <code>dbconfig</code> file</a> and See <a href="States.html#States">States of Problem Reports</a>.)
