<h3 class="section">B.4 <code>gnatsd</code> commands</h3>

<p><a name="index-_0040code_007bgnatsd_007d-commands-378"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007bgnatsd_007d-commands-379"></a>
Note that the set of <span class="sc">gnats</span> commands and their responses is somewhat
inconsistent and is very much in flux.  At present the <span class="sc">gnats</span>
clients are rather simple-minded and not very strict about processing
responses.  For example, if the server were to issue a code 300
(<code>CODE_PR_READY</code>) response to a <code>CHDB</code> command, the client
would happily expect to see a PR appear (and would print it out if one
was sent).

   <p>It is thus suggested that any clients that use the <span class="sc">gnats</span> protocol
be equally flexible about the way received responses are handled; in
particular, only the first digit of the response code should be assumed
to be meaningful, although subsequent digits are needed in some cases
(codes 300-399).  No attempt should be made to parse the message strings
on error response lines; they are only intended to be read by humans,
and will be changed on a regular basis.

   <p>Almost every command may result in the response 440
(<code>CODE_CMD_ERROR</code>).  This indicates that there was a problem with
the command arguments, usually because of insufficient or too many
arguments being specified.

   <p>Access to most <code>gnatsd</code> commands requires a certain <dfn>access
level</dfn>.  For details of this, see <a href="Privileged-gnatsd-commands.html#Privileged-gnatsd-commands">Privileged <code>gnatsd</code> commands</a>.

     <dl>
<dt><code>USER [</code><var>userid</var> <var>password</var><code>]</code><dd>Specifies the userid and password for database access.  Either both a
username and password must be specified, or they both may be omitted; in
the latter case, the current access level is returned.

     <p>The possible server responses are:

     <p><code>350 (CODE_INFORMATION)</code>
<br>The current access level is specified.

     <p><code>422 (CODE_NO_ACCESS)</code>
<br>A matching username and password could not be found.

     <p><code>200 (CODE_OK)</code>
<br>A matching username and password was found, and the login was
successful.

     <br><dt><code>QUIT</code><dd>Requests that the connection be closed. Possible responses:

     <p><code>201 (CODE_CLOSING)</code>
<br>Normal exit.

     <p>The <code>QUIT</code> command has the dubious distinction of being the only command
that cannot fail.

     <br><dt><code>LIST </code><var>list type</var><dd>Describes various aspects of the database.  The lists are returned as a
list of records, one per line.  Each line may contain a number of
colon-separated fields.

     <p>Possible values for <var>list type</var> include

     <p><code>Categories</code>
<br>Describes the legal categories for the database.

     <p><code>Submitters</code>
<br>Describes the set of submitters for the database.

     <p><code>Responsible</code>
<br>Lists the names in the responsible administrative file, including
their full names and email addresses.

     <p><code>States</code>
<br>Lists the states listed in the state administrative file, including
the state type (usually blank for most states; the closed state has a
special type).

     <p><code>FieldNames</code>
<br>Lists the entire set of PR fields.

     <p><code>InitialInputFields</code>
<br>Lists the fields that <em>should</em> be present when a PR is
initially entered.

     <p><code>InitialRequiredFields</code>
<br>Lists fields that <em>have</em> to be present and nonempty when a PR
is initially entered (fields containing only blank characters such as
spaces or newlines are considered empty.)

     <p><code>Databases</code>
<br>Lists the set of databases.

     <p>The possible responses are:

     <p><code>301 (CODE_TEXT_READY)</code>
<br>Normal response, followed by the records making up the list as
described above.

     <p><code>416 (CODE_INVALID_LIST)</code>
<br>The requested list does not exist.

     <br><dt><code>FTYP </code><var>field</var><code> [</code><var>field</var><code> ...]</code><dd>Describes the type of data held in the field(s) specified with the
command.  The currently defined data types are:

     <p><code>Text</code>
<br>A plain text field, containing exactly one line.

     <p><code>MultiText</code>
<br>A text field possibly containing multiple lines of text.

     <p><code>Enum</code>
<br>An enumerated data field; the value is restricted to one entry out of
a list of values associated with the field.

     <p><code>MultiEnum</code>
<br>The field contains one or more enumerated values.  Values are
separated with spaces or colons <span class="samp">:</span>.

     <p><code>Integer</code>
<br>The field contains an integer value, possibly signed.

     <p><code>Date</code>
<br>The field contains a date.

     <p><code>TextWithRegex</code>
<br>The value in the field must match one or more regular expressions
associated with the field.

     <p>The possible responses are:

     <p><code>350 (CODE_INFORMATION)</code>
<br>The normal response; the supplied text is the data type.

     <p><code>410 (CODE_INVALID_FIELD_NAME)</code>
<br>The specified field does not exist.

     <p>If multiple field names were given, multiple response lines will be
sent, one for each field, using the standard continuation protocol; each
response except the last will have a dash <span class="samp">-</span> immedately after the
response code.

     <br><dt><code>FTYPINFO </code><var>field</var> <var>property</var><dd>
Provides field-type-related information.  Currently, only the property
<span class="samp">separators</span> for MultiEnum fields is supported.  When
<span class="samp">separators</span> is specified, the possible return codes are:

     <p><code>350 (CODE_INFORMATION)</code>
A proper MultiEnum <var>field</var> was specified and the returned text is
the string of separators specified for the field in the dbconfig file
(see <a href="Field-datatypes.html#Field-datatypes">Field datatypes</a>) quoted in <code>'</code>'s.

     <p><code>435 (CODE_INVALID_FTYPE_PROPERTY)</code>
The <span class="samp">separators</span> property is not defined for this field, i.e.  the
specified <var>field</var> is not of type MultiEnum.

     <p>Currently, specifying a different property than <span class="samp">separators</span>
results in return code 435 as above.

     <br><dt><code>FDSC </code><var>field</var><code> [</code><var>field</var><code> ... ]</code><dd>Returns a human-readable description of the listed field(s).  The
possible responses are:

     <p><code>350 (CODE_INFORMATION)</code>
The normal response; the supplied text is the field description.

     <p><code>410 (CODE_INVALID_FIELD_NAME)</code>
The specified field does not exist.

     <p>Like the <code>FVLD</code> command, the standard continuation protocol will be
used if multiple fields were specified with the command.

     <br><dt><code>FIELDFLAGS </code><var>field</var><code> [</code><var>field</var><code> ... ]</code><dd>Returns a set of flags describing the specified field(s).  The possible
responses are either

     <p><code>410 (CODE_INVALID_FIELD_NAME)</code>
<br>meaning that the specified field is invalid or nonexistent, or

     <p><code>350 (CODE_INFORMATION)</code>
<br>which contains the set of flags for the field.  The flags may be
blank, which indicate that no special flags have been set for this
field.

     <p>Like the <code>FDSC</code> and <code>FTYP</code> commands, multiple field names may
be listed with the command, and a response line will be returned for
each one in the order that the fields appear on the command line.

     <p>The flags include:

     <p><code>textsearch</code>
<br>The field will be searched when a text field search is requested.

     <p><code>allowAnyValue</code>
<br>For fields that contain enumerated values, any legal value may be used
in the field, not just ones that appear in the enumerated list.

     <p><code>requireChangeReason</code>
<br>If the field is edited, a reason for the change must be supplied in
the new PR text describing the reason for the change. The reason must be
supplied as a multitext PR field in the new PR whose name is
<code>field-Changed-Why</code> (where <code>field</code> is the name of the field
being edited).

     <p><code>readonly</code>
<br>The field is read-only, and cannot be edited.

     <br><dt><code>FVLD </code><var>field</var><dd><br>Returns one or more regular expressions or strings that describe the
valid types of data that can be placed in field.  Exactly what is
returned is dependent on the type of data that can be stored in the
field.  For most fields a regular expression is returned; for enumerated
fields, the returned values are the list of legal strings that can be
held in the field.

     <p>The possible responses are:

     <p><code>301 (CODE_TEXT_READY)</code>
<br>The normal response, which is followed by the list of regexps or
strings.

     <p><code>410 (CODE_INVALID_FIELD_NAME)</code>
The specified field does not exist.

     <br><dt><code>VFLD </code><var>field</var><dd><code>VFLD</code> can be used to validate a given value for a field in the
database.  The client issues the <code>VFLD</code> command with the name of
the field to validate as an argument.  The server will either respond
with <code>212 (CODE_SEND_TEXT)</code>, or <code>410
(CODE_INVALID_FIELD_NAME)</code> if the specified field does not exist.

     <p>Once the <code>212</code> response is received from the server, the client
should then send the line(s) of text to be validated, using the normal
quoting mechanism described for PRs.  The final line of text is followed
by a line containing a single period, again as when sending PR text.

     <p>The server will then either respond with <code>210 (CODE_OK)</code>,
indicating that the text is acceptable, or one or more error codes
describing the problems with the field contents.

     <br><dt><code>INPUTDEFAULT </code><var>field</var><code> [</code><var>field</var><code> ... ]</code><dd>Returns the suggested default value for a field when a PR is initially
created.  The possible responses are either <code>410
(CODE_INVALID_FIELD_NAME)</code>, meaning that the specified field is invalid
or nonexistent, or <code>350 (CODE_INFORMATION)</code> which contains the
default value for the field.

     <p>Like the <code>FDSC</code> and <code>FTYP</code> commands, multiple field names may
be listed with the command, and a response line will be returned for
each one in the order that the fields appear on the command line.

     <br><dt><code>RSET</code><dd>Used to reset the internal server state.  The current query expression
is cleared, and the index of PRs may be reread if it has been updated
since the start of the session.  The possible responses are:

     <p><code>200 (CODE_OK)</code>
<br>The state has been reset.

     <p><code>440 (CODE_CMD_ERROR)</code>
<br>One or more arguments were supplied to the command.

     <p><code>6xx (internal error)</code>
<br>There were problems resetting the state (usually because the index could
not be reread).  The session will be immediately terminated.

     <br><dt><code>LKDB</code><dd>Locks the main <span class="sc">gnats</span> database.  No subsequent database locks will
succeed until the lock is removed.  Sessions that attempt to write to
the database will fail.  The possible responses are:

     <p><code>200 (CODE_OK)</code>
The lock has been established.

     <p><code>440 (CODE_CMD_ERROR)</code>
One or more arguments were supplied to the command.

     <p><code>431 (CODE_GNATS_LOCKED)</code>
The database is already locked, and the lock could not be obtained after
10 seconds.

     <p><code>6xx (internal error)</code>
An internal error occurred, usually because of permission or other
filesystem-related problems. The lock may or may not have been
established.

     <br><dt><code>UNDB</code><dd>
Unlocks the database.  Any session may steal a database lock; no
checking of any sort is done.  The possible responses are:

     <p><code>200 (CODE_OK)</code>
<br>The lock has been removed.

     <p><code>432 (CODE_GNATS_NOT_LOCKED)</code>
<br>The database was not locked.

     <p><code>440 (CODE_CMD_ERROR)</code>
<br>One or more arguments were supplied to the command.

     <p><code>6xx (internal error)</code>
<br>The database lock could not be removed, usually because of permissions
or other filesystem-related issues.

     <br><dt><code>LOCK </code><var>PR user</var><code> [</code><var>pid</var><code>]</code><dd>Locks the specified <var>PR</var>, marking the lock with the <var>user</var> name
and the optional <var>pid</var>. (No checking is done that the <var>user</var> or
<var>pid</var> arguments are valid or meaningful; they are simply treated as
strings.)

     <p>The <code>EDIT</code> command requires that the PR be locked before it may be
successfully executed.  However, it does not require that the lock is
owned by the editing session, so the usefulness of the lock is simply as
an advisory measure.

     <p>The <code>APPN</code> and <code>REPL</code> commands lock the PR as part of the
editing process, and they do not require that the PR be locked before
they are invoked.

     <p>The possible responses are:

     <p><code>440 (CODE_CMD_ERROR)</code>
<br>Insufficient or too many arguments were specified to the command.

     <p><code>300 (CODE_PR_READY)</code>
<br>The lock was successfully obtained; the text of the PR (using the
standard quoting mechanism for PRs) follows.

     <p><code>400 (CODE_NONEXISTENT_PR)</code>
<br>The PR specified does not exist.

     <p><code>430 (CODE_LOCKED_PR)</code>
<br>The PR is already locked by another session.

     <p><code>6xx (internal error)</code>
<br>The PR lock could not be created, usually because of permissions or
other filesystem-related issues.

     <br><dt><code>UNLK </code><var>PR</var><dd>Unlocks <var>PR</var>.  Any user may unlock a PR, as no checking is done to
determine if the requesting session owns the lock.

     <p>The possible responses are:

     <p><code>440 (CODE_CMD_ERROR)</code>
<br>Insufficient or too many arguments were specified to the command.

     <p><code>200 (CODE_OK)</code>
<br>The PR was successfully unlocked.

     <p><code>433 (CODE_PR_NOT_LOCKED)</code>
<br>The PR was not locked.

     <p><code>6xx (internal error)</code>
<br>The PR could not be unlocked, usually because of permission or other
filesystem-related problems.

     <br><dt><code>DELETE </code><var>PR</var><dd>Deletes the specified <var>PR</var>. The user making the request must have
admin privileges (see <a href="Access-Control.html#Access-Control">Controlling access to databases</a>).  If successful, the PR is removed from the filesystem and
the index file; a gap will be left in the numbering sequence for PRs. 
No checks are made that the PR is closed.

     <p>The possible responses are:

     <p><code>200 (CODE_OK)</code>
<br>The PR was successfully deleted.

     <p><code>422 (CODE_NO_ACCESS)</code>
<br>The user requesting the delete does not have admin privileges.

     <p><code>430 (CODE_LOCKED_PR)</code>
<br>The PR is locked by another session.

     <p><code>431 (CODE_GNATS_LOCKED)</code>
<br>The database has been locked, and no PRs may be updated until the lock
is cleared.

     <p><code>6xx (internal error)</code>
<br>The PR could not be successfully deleted, usually because of
permission or other filesystem-related problems.

     <br><dt><code>CHEK [initial]</code><dd>Used to check the text of an entire PR for errors.  Unlike the
<code>VFLD</code> command, it accepts an entire PR at once instead of the
contents of an individual field.

     <p>The <code>initial</code> argument indicates that the PR text to be checked is
for a PR that will be newly created, rather than an edit or replacement
of an existing PR.

     <p>After the <code>CHEK</code> command is issued, the server will respond with
either a <code>440 (CODE_CMD_ERROR)</code> response indicating that the
command arguments were incorrect, or a <code>211 (CODE_SEND_PR)</code>
response code will be sent.

     <p>Once the <code>211</code> response is received from the server, the client
should send the PR using the normal PR quoting mechanism; the final line
of the PR is then followed by a line containing a single period, as
usual.

     <p>The server will then respond with either a <code>200 (CODE_OK)</code>
response, indicating there were no problems with the supplied text, or
one or more error codes listing the problems with the PR.

     <br><dt><code>EDIT </code><var>PR</var><dd>Verifies the replacement text for <var>PR</var>.  If the command is
successful, the contents of <var>PR</var> are completely replaced with the
supplied text.  The PR must previously have been locked with the
<code>LOCK</code> command.

     <p>The possible responses are:

     <p><code>431 (CODE_GNATS_LOCKED)</code>
<br>The database has been locked, and no PRs may be updated until the lock
is cleared.

     <p><code>433 (CODE_PR_NOT_LOCKED)</code>
<br>The PR was not previously locked with the <code>LOCK</code> command.

     <p><code>400 (CODE_NONEXISTENT_PR)</code>
<br>The specified PR does not currently exist.  The <code>SUBM</code> command
should be used to create new PRs.

     <p><code>211 (CODE_SEND_PR)</code>
<br>The client should now transmit the replacement PR text using the
normal PR quoting mechanism.  After the PR has been sent, the server
will respond with either <code>200 (CODE_OK)</code> indicating that the edit
was successful, or one or more error codes listing problems either with
the replacement PR text or errors encountered while updating the PR file
or index.

     <br><dt><code>EDITADDR </code><var>address</var><dd>Sets the e-mail address of the person communicating with
<code>gnatsd</code>.  The command requires at least the <code>edit</code> access
level.

     <p>The possible responses are:

     <p><code>200 (CODE_OK)</code>
<br>The address was successfully set.

     <p><code>440 (CODE_CMD_ERROR)</code>
<br>Invalid number of arguments were supplied.

     <br><dt><code>APPN </code><var>PR</var> <var>field</var><dt><code>REPL </code><var>PR</var> <var>field</var><dd>Appends to or replaces the contents of <var>field</var> in <var>PR</var> with the
supplied text.  The command returns a <code>201 (CODE_SEND_TEXT)</code>
response; the client should then transmit the new field contents using
the standard PR quoting mechanism.  After the server has read the new
contents, it then attempts to make the requested change to the PR.

     <p>The possible responses are:

     <p><code>200 (CODE_OK)</code>
<br>The PR field was successfully changed.

     <p><code>400 (CODE_NONEXISTENT_PR)</code>
<br>The PR specified does not exist.

     <p><code>410 (CODE_INVALID_FIELD_NAME)</code>
<br>The specified field does not exist.

     <p><code>402 (CODE_UNREADABLE_PR)</code>
<br>The PR could not be read.

     <p><code>431 (CODE_GNATS_LOCKED)</code>
<br>The database has been locked, and no PRs may be updated until the lock
is cleared.

     <p><code>430 (CODE_LOCKED_PR)</code>
<br>The PR is locked, and may not be altered until the lock is cleared.

     <p><code>413 (CODE_INVALID_FIELD_CONTENTS)</code>
<br>The supplied (or resulting) field contents are not valid for the
field.

     <p><code>6xx (internal error)</code>
<br>An internal error occurred, usually because of permission or other
filesystem-related problems.  The PR may or may not have been altered.

     <br><dt><code>SUBM</code><dd>Submits a new PR into the database.  The supplied text is verified for
correctness, and if no problems are found a new PR is created.

     <p>The possible responses are:

     <p><code>431 (CODE_GNATS_LOCKED)</code>
<br>The database has been locked, and no PRs may be submitted until the
lock is cleared.

     <p><code>211 (CODE_SEND_PR)</code>
<br>The client should now transmit the new PR text using the normal
quoting mechanism.  After the PR has been sent, the server will respond
with either <code>351 (CODE_INFORMATION_FILLER)</code> and
<code>350 (CODE_INFORMATION)</code> responses indicating that the new PR
has been created and supplying the number assigned to it, or one or
more error codes listing problems with the new PR text.

     <br><dt><code>CHDB </code><var>database</var><dd>Switches the current database to the name specified in the command.

     <p>The possible responses are:

     <p><code>422 (CODE_NO_ACCESS)</code>
<br>The user does not have permission to access the requested database.

     <p><code>417 (CODE_INVALID_DATABASE)</code>
<br>The database specified does not exist, or one or more configuration
errors in the database were encountered.

     <p><code>220 (CODE_OK)</code>
<br>The current database is now <var>database</var>.  Any operations performed
will now be applied to <var>database</var>.

     <br><dt><code>DBLS</code><dd>Lists the known set of databases.

     <p>The possible responses are:

     <p><code>6xx (internal error)</code>
<br>An internal error was encountered while trying to obtain the list of
available databases, usually due to lack of permissions or other
filesystem-related problems, or the list of databases is empty.

     <p><code>301 (CODE_TEXT_READY)</code>
<br>The list of databases follows, one per line, using the standard
quoting mechanism.  Only the database names are sent.

     <p>The <code>gnatsd</code> access level <span class="samp">listdb</span> denies access until the
user has authenticated with the USER command.  The only other command
available at this access level is <code>DBLS</code>.  This access level
provides a way for a site to secure its <span class="sc">gnats</span> databases while still
providing a way for client tools to obtain a list of the databases for
use on login screens etc.  See <a href="Access-Control.html#Access-Control">Controlling access to databases</a>.

     <br><dt><code>DBDESC </code><var>database</var><dd>Returns a human-readable description of the specified <var>database</var>.

     <p>Responses include:

     <p><code>6xx (internal error)</code>
<br>An internal error was encountered while trying to read the list of
available databases, usually due to lack of permissions or other
filesystem-related problems, or the list of databases is empty.

     <p><code>350 (CODE_INFORMATION)</code>
<br>The normal response; the supplied text is the database description.

     <p><code>417 (CODE_INVALID_DATABASE)</code>
<br>The specified database name does not have an entry.

     <br><dt><code>EXPR </code><var>query expression</var><dd>Specifies a <var>query expression</var> used to limit which PRs are returned
from the <code>QUER</code> command.  The expression uses the normal query
expression syntax, (see <a href="Query-expressions.html#Query-expressions">Query expressions</a>).

     <p>Multiple <code>EXPR</code> commands may be issued; the expressions are boolean
ANDed together.

     <p>Expressions are cleared by the <code>RSET</code> command.

     <p>Possible responses include:

     <p><code>415 (CODE_INVALID_EXPR)</code>
<br>The specified expression is invalid, and could not be parsed.

     <p><code>200 (CODE_OK)</code>
<br>The expression has been accepted and will be used to limit the
results returned from <code>QUER</code>.

     <br><dt><code>QFMT </code><var>query format</var><dd>Use the specified <var>query format</var> to format the output of the
<code>QUER</code> command.  The query format may be either the name of a query
format known to the server (see <a href="Named-query-definitions.html#Named-query-definitions">Named query definitions</a>), or an
actual query format (see <a href="Formatting-query_002dpr-output.html#Formatting-query_002dpr-output">Formatting query-pr output</a>).  The possible
responses are:

     <p><code>200 (CODE_OK)</code>
<br>The normal response, which indicates that the query format is
acceptable.

     <p><code>440 (CODE_CMD_ERROR)</code>
<br>No query format was supplied.

     <p><code>418 (CODE_INVALID_QUERY_FORMAT)</code>
<br>The specified query format does not exist, or could not be parsed.
