I've just checked in my first round of changes.  There's a
GNATS_3_110_final CVS tag that refers to the latest version before my
changes.

I've included the verbiage I stuck into the BETA file below.  As
noted, the bloody thing is pretty bloody; it seems to mostly work, but
there are definitely some caveats, and it's nowhere near a finished
release.

Surprisingly enough I'm very interested in feedback, especially bug
reports and general code flamage.

Anyone have any strong opinions on:

	* giving up on K&amp;R function definitions et al?
	* using -Wall -ansi -pedantic etc. if gcc is used?

I'd like to do both, but I'm not going to be totally against leaving
the K&amp;R stuff there. On the other hand, it is 1999...and very few
compilers don't have basic ANSI-compliance these days.

I have been using -Wall et al in my testing, and it seems like mostly
a win.

The network protocol is in for some serious breakage soon.  I'll also
fix the port number, and see about getting a port reserved for it.

I will probably be working heavily on unrelated projects over the next
couple of days, but I will at least try to respond to email.

August 24th, 1999       GNATS 4.0 alpha "squirrel-1"

[alpha in a file called BETA? WTF? ;-]

I, Bob Manson &lt;bmanson@juniper.net&gt; having usurped GNATS
maintainership from the tenacious and wily grasp of Jason Molenda (who
valiantly fought for hours, nay days over it), I have decided to
further muddy the waters and try to add my own mark of ownership upon
that which is GNATS.

This is a horribly preliminary release of what will become GNATS 4.0.
It is considered way-blooding-nasty software, and you will verily lose
if you try to use it for anything other than playing.  It has
successfully been built on Solaris 2.6, Linux with glibc2.1, and some
release of FreeBSD (uname returns 2.2.8, whatever that means).

The most obvious external change is that the format of the fields in
the database are described in an external file (field-config).
Eventually it will be possible to add new fields via this
configuration file.  Presently this may only be used to change
existing fields, and it is not even possible to change simple things
like the name of a field.
The format of field-config is documented via some random and sundry
comments within it.  Eventually the parser will say something slightly
more useful than "syntax error at line xxx", and the lexer will cease
spewing out unrecognized keywords and characters to stdout.  Until
that day, be amused.

nquery-pr has been deleted, and its functionality is (mostly) merged
into query-pr.  ("Mostly" meaning that it is necessary to specify a
network-specific option such as --host in order to get it to do
network queries; this is lame lossage that needs to be fixed.)

It is also possible to do boolean searches via query-pr. Two new
options, `--and' and `--or' have been added.  There is currently no
support for this functionality via the network interface.

Boolean searches are constructed left-to-right, and there is currently
no parenthesis or other way to restructure queries.  Eventually a full
expression query syntax will be added, although the current search
functionality will be maintained.

Internally the code has undergone major surgery.  (I'm not even sure
where to start describing this.)  Searches are now consolidated into a
"QueryExpr" struct.  All of the global variables in qvariable.c have
been deleted, as well as most of the miscellaneous ones.  The madness
with "is_remote", and the random end-of-line variables is gone.  A lot
of static infrastructure surrounding fields has been removed.  A
generic interface has been added to the "random administrative files";
the contents thereof may eventually be merged into the field-config
file.  Several new structures have been added.  And with plenty of
other bad losingness added, I'm sure.

I just read the "PROBLEMS" file for the first time.  Hopefully most of
the real bug-type problems listed are moot. except for the
documentation issues.  ("Documentation is like castor oil: programmers
hate it, so managers claim it must be good for you.")

There's still a pile of work to do; much of it has been documented in
the TODO file.  Note that in these changes a Juniper-specific field
has been added.  This has been my benchmark for where in the process
things are; when it's totally included in the external config with no
mention of it elsewhere, that's presumably a good sign.
