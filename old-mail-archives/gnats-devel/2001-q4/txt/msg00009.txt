The role of the mail aliases has not changed as such, except that remote 
tools are now free to speak directly to the GNATS daemon. People can still 
send mail to the aliases and have it filed into the database, just as in 
GNATS 3.

The reason why GNATS_ADDR is obsolete is that send-pr now has its own 
configuration file (which is not documented yet -- the send-pr 
documentation is about the only part of the manual that is still to be 
revised), and the rest of GNATS needn't know about the PR submission address.
