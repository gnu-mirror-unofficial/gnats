&gt;hi,
&gt;i was just wondering about the login process of the gnatsweb...
&gt;i have installed gnatsweb and gnats and everything seems to be working 
&gt;fine. Except that i or my group can login as anything and type in any 
&gt;password we want...and the main page will still be shown and PRs can be 
&gt;created. Why is it that the main page still gets shown with any login and 
&gt;passwrd? what is the purpose of this page then?
&gt;what can i do to fix this problem?

(this is long but should answer most questions. I am also posting it to 
gnats-devel, since there are doubtless people there who will benefit)

This is a consequence of the weak security model employed by GNATS, and 
this weakness means that the only real benefit of requiring users to log in 
in a default GNATS 3 setup is that the user name will be used in the 
Audit-Trail so that tracking of who did what is possible. However, since 
anyone can pretend to be anyone, this system depens heavily on trust.

A user coming in has his or her access level set as follows:

First, the hostname of the machine the user comes in from is checked in the 
gnatsd.conf file of the database. This yields a certain access level.

Then the user can authenticate with username and password against the 
gnatsd.access file. If the user authenticates successfully, the access 
level in the gnatsd.access file is the one set for this user, but only if 
this access level is _higher_ than the one set for the user's host. If the 
user does not authenticate successfully, the access level of the user's 
host is the one which is set.

Furthermore, since GNATS' original design centres on receiving problem 
reports by e-mail (in fact, the network functionality with the associated 
gnats daemon hasn't been complete until GNATS version 4, which hasn't been 
released yet), submission of problem reports is not a restricted operation.

In GNATS 3 with Gnatsweb 2.x, what you could do would be to set 'view' 
access in gnatsd.conf for all hosts, then set up user accounts so that 
users can authenticate to higher access levels. Anyone would still be able 
to submit new PRs.

Ideally, you should be able to set access level 'none' for all hosts, so 
users would be required to authenticate in order to do anything. The 
problem with this is that Gnatsweb has to get a list of available databases 
before the user can be asked to log in, and that is not possible in GNATS 
3, since the DBLS command is unavailable when the access level is set to 
'none'. And still, anyone would be able to submit PRs. The DBLS problem 
will be fixed in GNATS 4, where there will be a separate access level which 
allows only the DBLS command to be executed.

Unfortunately, GNATS 4 will not be much improved wrt. to security, except 
for the DBLS fix. However, we have implemented a workaround in Gnatsweb 4. 
If you limit access to GNATS so that Gnatsweb is the only available 
interface, you can require users to authenticate against the web server 
before they're allowed access to Gnatsweb. Gnatsweb can be configured to 
pick up the username the user authenticated to the web server with and use 
that as the GNATS username. Basically, you would have an empty user 
database in gnatsd.access and an entry in gnatsd.conf saying

localhost:edit:

(assuming the web server runs on the GNATS server machine)

Gnatsweb 4 has a configuration switch which allows you to restrict 
submission of new PRs only to users who have 'edit access'. To stop 
unauthenticated submission through other channels in this kind of 
configuration, you would shut off incoming e-mail to the GNATS server 
(removing the pertinent mail aliases) since Gnatsweb 4 no longer uses 
e-mail to communicate with the GNATS server, then remove the send-pr 
utility from the GNATS server itself. People with user accounts on the 
GNATS server itself could still submit PRs by telneting from the GNATS 
server to port 1529 of the same server, then use gnatsd commands for 
submission. I consider this a minor and unimportant loophole -- a machine 
running both a GNATS and a web server should really not have any other 
users than admins. Coupled with web server authentication over SSL, this is 
a reasonably secure configuration, but one which ditches a lot of GNATS 
features that are hugely important for many sites.

All in all, GNATS security is messy and weak. I'd like to invite people to 
air their views on this subject -- perhaps we could end up with a 
specification for a more robust security and authentication model?
