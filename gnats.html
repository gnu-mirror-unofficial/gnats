    <h2><a href="#TOCintroduction" name="introduction">Introduction to
        GNATS</a></h2>
    <p>
      GNU GNATS is a set of tools for tracking bugs reported by users to a
      central site.  It allows problem report management and communication with
      users via various means.  GNATS stores all the information about problem
      reports in its databases and provides tools for querying, editing, and
      maintenance of the databases.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thanks to its architecture, GNATS is not bound to a single user
      interface--it can be used via command line, e-mail, Emacs, or a network
      daemon, usually used with a Web interface.  Together with the fact that
      all GNATS databases and configuration can be stored in plain text files,
      it allows easy use and provides good flexibility.  Basically, if the
      GNATS tools do not provide everything you need, you can add your own
      additional utilities using standard GNU tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a lot of confusion about the status of GNATS, and version
      numbering has been somewhat unclear.  There was a version 3.2 release in
      1993, but GNATS 3.2 is really broken, so don't use it.  Work continued on
      versions numbered 3.1xx, and many major advances have been made to GNATS
      in the last couple of years, including multiple database support,
      customized fields, and comprehensive WWW and Tk based front-ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      The newest GNATS release is 3.113.1, and the next official release of
      GNATS will be version 4.0.  After a lull in activity during the year
      2000, development efforts have picked up again.  The 4.0 documentation is
      nearly done, but some cleanup and bugfixing in the code itself remains.
      GNATS 4.0 has been through two alpha releases in 1999, but since then a
      lot of changes have been made, so we probably need another alpha version.
      A solid beta version is expected in late fall 2001.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several third-party interfaces and other tools that work with GNATS have
      been contributed, the most actively developed are
      <a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/gnatsweb">Gnatsweb</a>, a
      web-based interface, and TkGnats, a Tcl/Tk-based interface for UNIX/Linux
      and Windows, which can be found in the <tt>contrib</tt> subdirectory of
      the GNATS distribution.  Releases of these tools aren't necessarily
      synchronized with GNATS releases, see the section on
      <a href="#downloading">downloading</a> below for details on how to get
      the newest version.

    <h2><a href="#TOCdownloading" name="downloading">Downloading GNATS</a></h2>

    <h3>GNATS</h3>
    
    <p>
      The most recent released versions of GNATS are available from
      <a href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/gnats/">ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnats/</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last "official" version is 3.113.  If you consider to create a new
      GNATS installation, we recommend you to use the current development
      version of GNATS&nbsp;4.  The new version is slightly incompatible with
      the old one, it has many new useful features and we believe it is also
      more stable.  Moreover, we provide only a very limited support for
      GNATS&nbsp;3.
    </p>

    <p>
      The current development version is available via CVS only, see the
      <a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/gnats">GNU savannah GNATS
        project page</a> for the instructions how to get it.
    </p>
    <p>
      See <a href="#otherinfo">information about other GNATS resources</a> for
      the location of development code.  There are also available
      <a href="http://packages.debian.org/gnats">Debian packages</a> of both
      released and development versions of GNATS.
    </p>

    <h3>Gnatsweb</h3>
    
    <P>Gnatsweb, a GNATS web interface, development is hosted in a separate CVS
      repository at gnu.org.  Gnatsweb has two development branches, one for
      version 2 (which works with GNATS 3.x) and one for version 4 (which works
      with GNATS 4).
    </p>
    <p>
      Get the current <b>Gnatsweb 4</b> development code as follows:
    </p>
    <pre>cvs -d:pserver:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot/gnatsweb login
(press "enter" when prompted for password)
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot/gnatsweb co gnatsweb</pre>
    <p>
      Get the current <b>Gnatsweb 2</b> development code as follows:</p>
    <pre>cvs -d:pserver:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot/gnatsweb login
(press "enter" when prompted for password)
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot/gnatsweb co -r gnatsweb-v2-branch gnatsweb</pre>

    <p>
      Please report GNATS bugs to the

        bug tracking system</a> (preferred) or to the e-mail address

    </p>
    <p>
      GNATS uses (gasp) GNATS to track problem reports.  We've got the Gnatsweb
      web interface set up so you can
      <a href="http://bugs.gnu.org/cgi-bin/gnatsweb.pl?database=gnats">browse
	the database or submit new problem reports</a> there.
      Use <tt>guest</tt> as both the login name and the password.  You can also
      try out the Gnatsweb interface if you want to see how things look, but
      please do not submit reports that aren't real.  This database is being
      used by GNATS developers, and is <em>not meant for testing purposes</em>.

    <h2><a href="#TOCgettinginvolved" name="gettinginvolved">Getting involved
        in GNATS development</a></h2>
    
    <p>
      We are always on the lookout for people willing to contribute to the
      project.  We need more active developers.  Besides, patches for existing
      problems, contributions to documentation, answers to frequently asked
      questions or ideas for future development are all very welcome.  And, if
      you aren't a developer or feel able to write good documentation, there is
      still something you can do: Simply <em>use GNATS</em> and
      <a href="#bugreporting">report any bugs and quirks you may find</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>GNATS</h3>
    <p>
      The current maintainer of GNATS itself is
      <a href="http://www.zamazal.org">Milan Zamazal</a>.  The immediate goal
      is to get a usable version of GNATS&nbsp;4 out of the door.  This
      involves making it more robust and updating the documentation.
    </p>

    <h3>Gnatsweb</h3>
    <p>
      The current maintainers of Gnatsweb are
      <a href="http://www.yngve.com">Yngve Svendsen</a> and
      <a href="http://www.dbai.tuwien.ac.at/~pfeifer/">Gerald Pfeifer</a>.
      Several Gnatsweb 2.x releases have been made in the past 6 months, fixing
      bugs and improving usability and functionality.  The 2.x branch is
      however purely in maintenance mode now, and no further releases are
      planned unless bugs of earth-shattering importance surface.  Focus is now
      on version 4 of Gnatsweb, which will work only with GNATS 4.  A beta
      release of Gnatsweb 4 is available as part of the current
      <a href="#downloading">CVS version of GNATS 4</a>.  See the section above
      on <a href="#downloading">availability of development versions</a> for
      instructions on how to obtain the latest development snapshot of Gnatsweb
      4.  Anyone interested in participating in Gnatsweb development either by
      submitting patches or taking directly part in planning and development
      should get in touch with Yngve or Gerald.  Patches should in general be
      sent to the
      <a href="http://mail.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/help-gnats">help-gnats
        mailing list</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>How to produce patches</h3>
    <p>
      Even though people may have good coding skills, they may
      never have submitted patches to projects such as this before.  Following
      is a quick how-to on producing a patch file.
    </p>
    <p>
      Check out the GNATS version you intend to modify
      <a href="#downloading">from the CVS repository</a>, then make
      the changes you intend to. To produce the patchfile, use the following
      command:
    </p>
    <pre>cvs diff -up file1 file2 ... &gt; patchfile.out</pre>
    <p>
      where <samp>file1</samp>, <samp>file2</samp> etc. are the paths to the
      files that you changed in the source tree.  This creates a patch file
      <samp>patchfile.out</samp> which contains the differences between the
      source files in the CVS repository and the checked out files you edited.
      Since current development efforts are directed at getting version 4 out
      of the door, patches against the latest development version will be most
      useful.  Patches should go to the
      <a href="http://mail.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/help-gnats">help-gnats
        mailing list</a>.
