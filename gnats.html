	 <H2><A HREF="#TOCintroduction" NAME="introduction">Introduction to
		GNATS</A></H2> 
	 <P> GNU GNATS is a set of tools for tracking bugs reported by users to a
		central site. It allows problem report management and communication with users
		via various means. GNATS stores all the information about problem reports in
		its databases and provides tools for querying, editing, and maintenance of the
		databases. </P> 
	 <P> Thanks to its architecture, GNATS is not bound to a single user
		interface--it can be used via command line, e-mail, Emacs, or a network daemon,
		usually used with a Web interface. Together with the fact that all GNATS
		databases and configuration can be stored in plain text files, it allows easy
		use and provides good flexibility. Basically, if the GNATS tools do not provide
		everything you need, you can add your own additional utilities using standard
		GNU tools. </P> 
	 <P> There is a lot of confusion about the status of GNATS, and version
		numbering has been somewhat unclear. There was a version 3.2 release in 1993,
		but GNATS 3.2 is really broken, so don't use it. Work continued on versions
		numbered 3.1xx, and many major advances have been made to GNATS in the last
		couple of years, including multiple database support, customized fields, and
		comprehensive WWW and Tk based front-ends. </P> 
	 <P> The newest GNATS release is 3.113.1, and the next official release of
		GNATS will be version 4.0. After a lull in activity during the year 2000,
		development efforts have picked up again. The 4.0 documentation is nearly done,
		but some cleanup and bugfixing in the code itself remains. GNATS 4.0 has been
		through two alpha releases in 1999, and the <A HREF="#news">first beta
		version</A> appeared at the end of 2001.</P> 
	 <P> Several third-party interfaces and other tools that work with GNATS
		have been contributed, the most actively developed are
		<A HREF="http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/gnatsweb">Gnatsweb</A>, a web-based
		interface, and TkGnats, a Tcl/Tk-based interface for UNIX/Linux and Windows,
		which can be found in the <TT>contrib</TT> subdirectory of the GNATS
		distribution. Releases of these tools aren't necessarily synchronized with
		GNATS releases, see the section on <A HREF="#downloading">downloading</A> below
		for details on how to get the newest version. </P> 
	 <P> If you'd like to hear about GNATS announcements, subscribe to the
		<A HREF="http://mail.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/info-gnats">info-gnats mailing
		list</A>.</P>

	 <P><B>December 29, 2001:</B> The long-awaited first beta release of GNATS
		4.0 is available for download from
		<A
		HREF="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/gnats/gnats-3.999.1.tar.gz">
        ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/gnats/gnats-3.999.1.tar.gz</A>.
		This version shouldn't be considered ready for production use. Download,
		install and test it and <A HREF="#bugreporting">report any problems you may
		encounter</A>.</P><!-- *** -->
	 <H2><A HREF="#TOCdownloading" NAME="downloading">Downloading GNATS</A></H2>
	 
	 <H3>GNATS</H3> 
	 <P> The most recent released versions of GNATS are available from
		<A
		 HREF="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/gnats/">ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/gnats/</A>.
		</P> 
	 <P> The last "official" version is 3.113. If you consider to create a new
		GNATS installation, we recommend you to use the current development version of
		GNATS&nbsp;4. The new version is slightly incompatible with the old one, it has
		many new useful features and we believe it is also more stable. Moreover, we
		provide only a very limited support for GNATS&nbsp;3. </P> 
	 <P> The current development version is available via CVS only, see the
		<A HREF="http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/gnats">GNU savannah GNATS project
		page</A> for the instructions how to get it. </P> 
	 <P> See <A HREF="#otherinfo">information about other GNATS resources</A>
		for the location of development code. There are also available
		<A HREF="http://packages.debian.org/gnats">Debian packages</A> of both released
		and development versions of GNATS. </P> 
	 <H3>Gnatsweb</H3> 
	 <P>Gnatsweb, a GNATS web interface, development is hosted in a separate CVS
		repository at gnu.org. Gnatsweb has two development branches, one for version 2
		(which works with GNATS 3.x) and one for version 4 (which works with GNATS 4).
		</P> 
	 <P> Released versions of Gnatsweb can be downloaded from
		<A
		 HREF="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/gnatsweb/">ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/gnatsweb/</A>.
		</P> 
	 <P> Get the current <B>Gnatsweb 4</B> development code as follows: </P> 
	 <PRE>cvs -d:pserver:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot/gnatsweb login
(press "enter" when prompted for password)
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot/gnatsweb co gnatsweb</PRE>

	 <H2><A HREF="#TOCbugreporting" NAME="bugreporting">Reporting GNATS
		Bugs</A></H2> 
	 <P> Please report GNATS bugs to the
		<A HREF="http://bugs.gnu.org/cgi-bin/gnatsweb.pl?database=gnats">GNATS bug
		tracking system</A> (preferred) or to the e-mail address
		<A HREF="mailto:bug-gnats@gnu.org">&lt;bug-gnats@gnu.org&gt;</A>. </P> 
	 <P> GNATS uses (gasp) GNATS to track problem reports. We've got the
		Gnatsweb web interface set up so you can
		<A HREF="http://bugs.gnu.org/cgi-bin/gnatsweb.pl?database=gnats">browse the
		database or submit new problem reports</A> there. Use <TT>guest</TT> as both
		the login name and the password. You can also try out the Gnatsweb interface if
		you want to see how things look, but please do not submit reports that aren't
		real. This database is being used by GNATS developers, and is <EM>not meant for
		testing purposes</EM>. </P> 
	 <P> When you report problems related GNATS itself, <EM>please don't forget
		to provide especially the following information</EM>: </P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI>The GNATS version you are using.</LI> 
		<LI>The <EM>exact</EM> way how to reproduce the bug.</LI> 
		<LI>Your configuration.</LI> 
		<LI>If you encounter a compilation or build problem, it is especially
		  important to mention the operating system, compiler and possibly other build
		  utilities you use.</LI> 
	 </UL> 
	 <P> Providing this information in the initial report avoids further
		unnecessary communication, saves our limited development resources and helps to
		track down and fix the problem soon. </P> 
	 <P> All PR transactions/additions/changes are recorded on the
		<A HREF="http://mail.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gnats-prs">gnats-prs mailing
		list</A>. </P>

	 <H2><A HREF="#TOCgettinginvolved" NAME="gettinginvolved">Getting involved
		in GNATS development</A></H2> 
	 <P> We are always on the lookout for people willing to contribute to the
		project. We need more active developers. Besides, patches for existing
		problems, contributions to documentation, answers to frequently asked questions
		or ideas for future development are all very welcome. And, if you aren't a
		developer or feel able to write good documentation, there is still something
		you can do: Simply <EM>use GNATS</EM> and <A HREF="#bugreporting">report any
		bugs and quirks you may find</A>. </P> 
	 <H3>GNATS</H3> 
	 <P> The current maintainer of GNATS itself is
		<A HREF="http://www.zamazal.org">Milan Zamazal</A>. The immediate goal is to
		get a usable version of GNATS&nbsp;4 out of the door. This involves making it
		more robust and updating the documentation. </P> 
	 <H3>Gnatsweb</H3> 
	 <P> The current maintainers of Gnatsweb are <A
		HREF="http://www.yngve.com">Yngve Svendsen</A> and
		<A HREF="http://www.dbai.tuwien.ac.at/~pfeifer/">Gerald Pfeifer</A>. Several
		Gnatsweb 2.x releases have been made in the past 6 months, fixing bugs and
		improving usability and functionality. The 2.x branch is however purely in
		maintenance mode now, and no further releases are planned unless bugs of
		earth-shattering importance surface. Focus is now on version 4 of Gnatsweb,
		which will work only with GNATS 4. A beta release of Gnatsweb 4 is available as
		part of the current <A HREF="#downloading">CVS version of GNATS 4</A>. See the
		section above on <A HREF="#downloading">availability of development
		versions</A> for instructions on how to obtain the latest development snapshot
		of Gnatsweb 4. Anyone interested in participating in Gnatsweb development
		either by submitting patches or taking directly part in planning and
		development should get in touch with Yngve or Gerald. Patches should in general
		be sent to the <A
		HREF="http://mail.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/help-gnats">help-gnats mailing
		list</A>. </P> 
	 <H3>How to produce patches</H3> 
	 <P> Even though people may have good coding skills, they may never have
		submitted patches to projects such as this before. Following is a quick how-to
		on producing a patch file. </P> 
	 <P> Check out the GNATS version you intend to modify <A
		HREF="#downloading">from the CVS repository</A>, then make the changes you
		intend to. To produce the patchfile, use the following command: </P> 
	 <PRE>cvs diff -up file1 file2 ... &gt; patchfile.out</PRE> 
	 <P> where <SAMP>file1</SAMP>, <SAMP>file2</SAMP> etc. are the paths to the
		files that you changed in the source tree. This creates a patch file
		<SAMP>patchfile.out</SAMP> which contains the differences between the source
		files in the CVS repository and the checked out files you edited. Since current
		development efforts are directed at getting version 4 out of the door, patches
		against the latest development version will be most useful. Patches should go
		to the <A HREF="http://mail.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/help-gnats">help-gnats
		mailing list</A>. </P> 
	 <P> Full CVS documentation is available at
		<A
