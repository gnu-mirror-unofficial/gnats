	 <P><B>2001-10-23</B>: Gnatsweb 2.9.2 available. This is a minor bug-fix release.
		For details, read the
		<A
		 HREF="http://sources.redhat.com/ml/gnats-announce/2001/msg00005.html">complete
		announcement</A>. Get it from <A
		HREF="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnatsweb/">ftp.gnu.org</A> or any of its
		<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html">mirrors</A>. (Note that Gnatsweb
		2.x only supports GNATS 3.x. Gnatsweb 4.0 will only support the
		soon-to-be-released GNATS 4.</P> 
	 <P><B>2001-09-28</B>: A preliminary version of the GNATS 4.0 manual is
		available from the <A HREF="gnats_toc.html">documentation page</A>.</P> 
	 <P><B>2001-06-26:</B> A serious security flaw has been uncovered in
		versions 2.7beta up to and including version 2.8.1 of Gnatsweb.
		<A HREF="gnatsweb/advisory-jun-26-2001.html">Read the advisory and apply the
		patch</A> as soon as possible! </P> 
	 <P><B>2001-05-15</B>:
		<A HREF="http://sources.redhat.com/ml/gnats-announce/2001/msg00000.html">GNATS
		3.113.1</A> released. Minor release, fixing some of the more serious problems
		found in 3.113. New versions of Gnatsweb and TkGnats (2.8.0 and 3.0.18 resp.)
		are included. This is meant as a more or less final release on the GNATS 3.x
		branch.</P> 
	 <H2><A NAME="what">What is it?</A></H2> 
	 <P>GNATS is a freely redistributable set of tools for tracking bug reports.
		It is one of the most robust bug tracking systems on the net, and is in
		production use by many companies and free software projects.</P> 
	 <P>There is a lot of confusion about the status of GNATS, and version
		numbering has been somewhat unclear. There was a version 3.2 release in 1993,
		but GNATS 3.2 is really broken, so <B>don't use it</B>. Work continued on
		versions numbered 3.1xx, and many major advances have been made to GNATS in the
		last couple of years, including multiple database support, customized fields,
		and comprehensive WWW and Tk based front-ends.</P> 
	 <P>The newest GNATS release is 3.113.1, and the next official release of
		GNATS will be version 4.0. After a lull in activity during the year 2000,
		development efforts have picked up again. The 4.0 documentation is nearly done,
		but some cleanup and bugfixing in the code itself remains. GNATS 4.0 has been
		through two alpha releases in 1999, but since then a lot of changes have been
		made, so we probably need another alpha version. A solid beta version is
		expected in late fall 2001.</P> 
	 <P>Several third-party interfaces and other tools that work with GNATS have
		been contributed, the most actively developed are Gnatsweb, a web-based
		interface, and TkGnats, a Tcl/Tk-based interface for UNIX/Linux and Windows.
		These can be found in the <TT>contrib</TT> subdirectory of the GNATS
		distribution. Releases of these tools aren't necessarily synchronized with
		GNATS releases &#150; see the section on <A
		HREF="#availability">Availability</A> below for details on how to get the
		newest version.</P>

	 <P>GNATS uses (gasp) GNATS to track problem reports. We've got the Gnatsweb
		web interface set up so you can
		<A
		 HREF="http://sources.redhat.com/cgi-bin/gnatsweb.pl?database=gnats&amp;user=guest&amp;password=guest&amp;cmd=login">browse
		the database or submit new problem reports</A>. You can also try out the
		Gnatsweb interface if you want to see how things look, but please do not submit
		reports that aren't real. This database is being used by GNATS developers, and
		is <B>not meant for testing purposes</B>.</P> 
	 <P>All PR transactions/additions/changes are recorded on the
		gnats-prs@sourceware.cygnus.com mailing list, which has an associated
		<A HREF="http://sources.redhat.com/ml/gnats-prs/">web archive</A>.</P> 
	 <H2><A NAME="gettinginvolved">Getting involved</A></H2> 
	 <P>We are always on the lookout for people willing to contribute to the
		project. We need more active developers. Besides, patches for existing
		problems, contributions to documentation, answers to frequently asked questions
		or ideas for future development are all very welcome. And, if you aren't a
		developer or feel able to write good documentation, there is still something
		you can do: Simply <B>use GNATS</B> and
		<A
		 HREF="http://sources.redhat.com/cgi-bin/gnatsweb.pl?database=gnats&amp;user=guest&amp;password=guest&amp;cmd=login">report
		any bugs and quirks you may find</A>.</P> 
	 <H3>GNATS</H3> 
	 <P> The current maintainer of GNATS itself is
		<A HREF="http://www.zamazal.org">Milan Zamazal</A>. The immediate goal is to
		get a usable version of GNATS 4 out of the door. This involves making it more
		robust and updating the documentation. Since development of GNATS lapsed in
		early 2000, a number of patches have been submitted. These will be applied, and
		any patches that haven't been submitted due to the uncertain status of GNATS
		should be sent to the <A HREF="#subscribe">gnats-dev mailing list</A>. Still,
		the unreleased version 4 requires more work, and people interested in
		contributing, whether as documentation authors or as developers, should get in
		touch with him.</P> 
	 <H3>Gnatsweb</H3> 
	 <P>The current maintainers of Gnatsweb are <A
		HREF="http://www.yngve.com">Yngve Svendsen</A> and
		<A HREF="http://www.dbai.tuwien.ac.at/~pfeifer/">Gerald Pfeifer</A>. Several
		Gnatsweb 2.x releases have been made in the past 6 months, fixing bugs and
		improving usability and functionality. The 2.x branch is however purely in
		maintenance mode now, and no further releases are planned unless bugs of
		earth-shattering importance surface. Focus is now on version 4 of Gnatsweb,
		which will work only with GNATS 4. A beta release of Gnatsweb 4 is available as
		part of the current <A HREF="#availability_development">CVS version of GNATS
		4</A>. See the section above on <A
		HREF="#availability_development">availability of development versions</A> for
		instructions on how to obtain the latest development snapshot of Gnatsweb 4.
		Anyone interested in participating in Gnatsweb development either by submitting
		patches or taking directly part in planning and development should get in touch
		with Yngve or Gerald. Patches should in general be sent to the
		<A HREF="#subscribe">gnats-dev mailing list</A>.</P> 
	 <H3>How to produce patches</H3> 
	 <P>Even though people may have good coding skills, they may never have
		submitted patches to projects such as this before. Following is a quick how-to
		on producing a patch file.</P> 
	 <P>Check out the GNATS version you intend to modify
		<A HREF="#availability_development">from the CVS repository</A>, then make the
		changes you intend to. To produce the patchfile, use the following command:</P>
	 
	 <PRE>cvs diff -up file1 file2 ... &gt; patchfile.out</PRE> 
	 <P>where file1, file2 etc. are the paths to the files that you changed in
		the source tree. This creates a patch file patchfile.out which contains the
		differences between the source files in the CVS repository and the checked out
		files you edited. Since current development efforts are directed at getting
		version 4 out of the door, patches against the latest development version will
		be most useful. Patches should go to the <A HREF="#subscribe">gnats-dev mailing
		list</A>.</P>
